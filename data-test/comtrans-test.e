In particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the LEADER II initiative .
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density .
The rapporteur ' s phrasing was therefore too limiting .
In the territory of Member States of the European Union , applicant countries or Member States of EFTA , there may be interrelations between the various Community initiatives .
The real priority for the European continent is to establish an operational level within a European framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur .
The creation of organisations similar to the LAGs may be usefully encouraged by the European Union , provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners .
In essence , we are , of course , in favour of this LEADER + Community Initiative .
The budget allocated to LEADER + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to LEADER II for a period of six years .
This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements .

Additives in feedingstuffs
Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , under Directive 70 / 524 , high-technology additives are treated differently , depending on the date of authorisation .
The Commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances licensed before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now .
As far as we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are concerned , so far so good .
However , the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics , drugs , growth-promoters and genetically-modified organisms .
We asked the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , which pointed out that , as far as approximating laws is concerned , Article 37 is adequate in this case .
Mr Byrne , we fail to understand why the Commission is not approximating the text on genetically-modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work .
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text .
Moreover , this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well .
The Commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future .
However , that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives .
We are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically-modified organisms .
We therefore assume , Commissioner Byrne , that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base .
In other words , we do not need to re-negotiate the text ; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive .
I can hardly wait , Commissioner Byrne , to hear what you have to say to our proposals .
Mr President , Commissioner , does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy ?
As far the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee are concerned , it comes under competition .
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988 .
We want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and Mr Doyle ' s proposed Amendments Nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support .
However , as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said in his report , this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter .
Food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions .
When we talk of transparency in the food chain , that applies from the hayfork to the table fork and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs .
The antibiotics , growth promoters and genetically-modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain .
The dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction .
According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty , we are obliged to obviate sources of danger to human health , whereby the accent is clearly on sources .
Consequently , we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger , i.e. harmful additives in feedingstuffs .
Otherwise , in my view , we are beavering away at the symptoms , but not the causes .
People are especially wary of GMOs .
We must confront increasing public awareness of GMOs by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly .
First , if an additive consists of or contains genetically-modified organisms , then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment .
Secondly , it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically-modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur has said .
And thirdly , if we are to have a transparent consumer policy , we need to label genetically-modified feedingstuffs .
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer .
Responsible citizens should , in my view , have a choice .
We all talk of scandalised citizens who have lost confidence in food safety .
By regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently , we can help significantly to restore confidence .
I too , therefore , can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments .
Consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be .
Mr President , this proposal to amend the 1970 directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs .
In other words , we shall be discussing other proposals here in Parliament over the next few months .
That this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin , antibiotic , sludge and other scandals have attracted .
In other words , this is an important facet of public health protection , which is why we believe that Article 152 should be taken as the legal base , not Article 37 , as proposed by the Commission .
The amendment which the Commission has proposed , namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 December 1987 , is uncontested and has our full support .
However , the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the Commission proposal .
The regulation proposed by the Commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives .
Only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded .
This would then apply until the re-assessment procedure has been completed .
This already gives us a basis for the authorisation of GMOs .
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect .
Finally , our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur , who has gone to a great deal of trouble .
I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne ' s reply .
Mr President , the report deals mainly with formalities , in other words , the manner in which additives will be authorised .
It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work .
We cannot carry on as we have done up until now , that is to say dealing with each detail on its own , often only after the harm has already been done .
The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives .
However , I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics .
We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people 's health , particularly in the case of small children .
A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary .
Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same .
We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but , in the case of antibiotics , it has long since been forgotten .
However , there is another environmental principle at stake , namely the exchange principle .
I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats .
They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary . There is a substitute , which is used to vaccinate chickens .
Although it is a little more expensive , it does not harm the environment .
Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields . In that way , they end up in our water supplies which , as we all know , are our most vital resource .
We must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals .
Incidentally , it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our dogs , cats and other domestic animals .
Is it because of cut-throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri-foodstuffs industry ?
Such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate , even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters .
The precautions which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our plates .
As forcefully underlined by this report , labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock .
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health .
In any case , the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly traceable at all stages of their marketing .
However , before labelling we need clear rules .
Straight questions must be asked about the real end-use of animal meal , for example .
Although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms , it is their use which must be questioned today .
In this respect , the chapter of the White Paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions .
The Commission has on many occasions used the farm-to-table example which our colleague in the PPE Group has just underlined .
This is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and , to do this , the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time .
Also , Amendments Nos 4 and 5 to the new Article 2a must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such , thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions .
This directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own .
Other directives will follow and I believe that the Committee on Agriculture is well placed to deal with them .
Up the point at which meat , milk , bread and other products are sold over the shop counter , feedingstuffs and additives are structured , mixed , blended , cut and transported several times .
The fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems , just as it does in the foodstuffs industry .
The negative consequences are well known , the positive ones less so .
I am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of European citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region .
However , more work is needed on this .
Mr President , may I commence by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on his report . It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the area of food safety and quality .
The events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health .
But even in this crucial area of administration , Parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging Member States to take on and to face up to their responsibility .
In Agenda 2000 , we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens : food safety , water quality , environmental protection and rural development .
If we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence , the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people-focused and very much reflect community needs .
I welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds .
Those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely .
I compliment the new Commissioner responsible for food safety , Mr Byrne .
He has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this House , as well as to the concern of consumers .
I am particularly pleased that my own country , Ireland , is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability .
This will make the island of Ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work . I am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group .
A coherent legal framework must be re-established .
As of October 1999 the Commission proposed introducing a legal basis into Directive 70 / 524 / EEC for the replacement of the authorisations .
However , we must ensure that competition distortions are not created , as highlighted by Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi .
Genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end-consumer to choose food without GMO components or based on GMO components and to guarantee this .
The consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision .
This proposal has no financial consequences for the Community budget .
There must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety .
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which , as you know , was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Mr President , we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection .
We therefore welcome the Commission ' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs .
Nevertheless , I should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points .
First , perhaps , I should say something on the question of the legal base .
Therefore , and I must address this comment to you Mr Byrne , I reject your choice of legal basis .
If it is merely a hand-me-down legal basis taken over from previous directives , then it is a mistake to keep it .
My group , as Mr Kindermann has already said , will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and I hope that other groups in this House will do likewise .
Mr Byrne , I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation .
If we do not change it and we follow the Legal Affairs Committee , we shall be opening the floodgates to manipulation .
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37 .
Allow me to comment briefly on two other points . First , genetically modified micro-organisms in feedingstuffs .
We cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law .
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign .
It is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the Member States .
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
This is an issue that we will no doubt be reconsidering on a number of occasions in the future .
What has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers .
We must strike a balance between them .
We must resolve this issue , because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat .
One way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned .
GMOs are the new challenge facing us .
This is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so : I myself share these concerns .
But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed .
Indeed , we should not allow GMOs to obscure the fact that meat and bonemeal are still included in animal feeds in many countries in Europe .
One factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between Member States on the cost of the production of food .
These are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field : food must be of the same standard in all Member States .
We have had the dioxin scare , BSE and many other problems .
The main problem is a financial one , namely who bears the cost ?
The problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer has been forced to bear all the cost .
We need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred .
We must also ensure that the food that is imported into the European Union meets the standards within the European Union .
If we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future .
.
I should first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur , the committee chairman , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for examining the Commission 's proposal .
The Commission proposal is , as some of you have said , rather technical .
Nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective : to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives .
At present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations , depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 January 1988 .
The purpose of the Commission 's proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists .
The scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited .
Five amendments have been presented by Parliament .
I shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately .
The first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing Article 37 with Article 152 .
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection .
The proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health .
I note that Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also accepts that Article 37 is the appropriate legal base .
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health .
I commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the Legal Affairs Committee which sets out the position , in my view , with precision , clarity and commendable brevity .
Amendments Nos 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives .
I am the first to accept that GMOs are a very important issue .
I also accept and acknowledge that a number of initiatives to update EU legislation in the field of GMOs are necessary .
However , this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives .
The Commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by Directive 70 / 524 on genetically modified additives at this stage .
Instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90 / 220 , which is currently in second reading in Parliament .
The Commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments .
I can also assure Parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account .
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give undue preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted .
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations .
I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues .
I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate .
This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives .
The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998 .
But the vertical legislation in Directive 90 / 220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing .
It is before Parliament for second reading .
It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90 / 220 and in particular , Article 11 .
Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies .
Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this .
There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue .
First of all , this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993 , so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers .
Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product .
I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base , whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152 .
The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this .
A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling .
Directive 70 / 524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives .
It is already included now : " indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products " .
So this issue will be addressed .
That formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product , the subject matter of the application .
Mr President , allow me to ask the Commissioner one more question .
First allow me to point out , Commissioner Byrne , that the European Parliament has no right of legislative initiative .
But we do reserve the right , when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation , to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out .
Nonetheless , we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content .
For example , you did not go into antibiotics .
We are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives .
My question , Commissioner Byrne is this : the UN conference in Montreal decided that genetically-modified organisms must be labelled for international trade .
Do you really believe that , if we could , Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union ?
Commissioner Byrne , it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with Parliament .
We negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years .
I look forward to the next round .
I would stress that no GMOs have been approved under this directive ; it applies only to additives .
I would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue . It is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way , particularly in Directive 90 / 220 .
This issue is before Parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it , which will also come under the legal base of Article 152 which gives Parliament full competence in the areas of codecision .
I would assure Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it is by no means my intention or wish to have any clash or test of strength with Parliament on this issue .
It is my intention , as it has always been , to work in cooperation with Parliament , to ensure that the results we achieve are the very best results .
It is best to wait for that debate which , I understand , will take place fairly soon .
All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Parliament has taken due note of your comments .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Scrapie
No new knowledge was needed , because the theory from the beginning was that BSE and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold .
From this point of view we are slightly behind the times .
I am therefore in complete agreement with the Commission ' s proposal on scrapie .
I should , however , like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new TSE regulation allows a reasonable symbiosis between consumer protection and practicable suggestions .
We therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the TSE proposal , and that of course includes scrapie .
We insist on this .
I should also like to address two other points . We expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of Member States as regards outbreaks of scrapie or TSEs .
Here again the Commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by Parliament .
Finally , in discussing the question of the future application of tests , we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable .
Mr President , over the years , the following situation has arisen : one subject has developed into a subject of many facets .
Many of us here in this House have spent years , whether we intended to or not , dealing solely with the consequences of the BSE scandal right down to the last detail .
And it is still on the agenda today .
It is therefore hardly surprising that I and Mr Böge are talking about it and that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just mentioned it in his report .
The cast is always the same .
Although the cause was unfortunate , it was certainly not the worst experience of this Parliament .
My task as draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee is a very simple one .
I agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the Environment Committee has asked the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to agree to the Commission proposal .
That saves a great deal of time which I would like to use for other things and which I shall use now somewhat in anticipation , as Mr Böge has just done .
I have yet to submit my report on TSEs to the House .
At first we were somewhat irresolute and we regret that now .
But I have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing .
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity , Mr Byrne , to give the Commission a few things to think about .
It will become more difficult once we see the TSE proposal , Mr Byrne .
When we have the chance to ask direct questions , the questions which Mr Böge referred to will be asked .
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries .
How will BSE status in fact be defined then ?
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test ?
And then there is my standing question to you Mr Byrne , a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you . What about the BSE test ?
When will you make it compulsory ?
Perhaps you will do so before Parliament debates the TSE report .
Not that I want to put it off , but it would be a gesture , as it were , if you could say : here is the proposed legislation on the BSE test .
I know that I am a thorn in your side on this , but sometimes that is my job .
Cosmetic , medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous .
That is , without doubt , too short , too sweet and too little .
Finally , just one more brief comment , Mr Byrne .
We have a new Commission .
Whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this Commission and the President of the Commission , only time will tell .
They belong in the legislative text .
But you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this .
In other words , whenever I get the chance , I shall take everything out of the annexes and cram it into the legislative text .
And you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset .
Over recent years , these basic principles have often been neglected in animal husbandry and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or greed .
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals .
We should not allow food safety to be compromised because , in the final analysis , it is our health which is at stake .
The Commission ' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a Community regulation to fight scrapie .
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated .
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent .
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers .
And I should point out that , for the first time in history , a case of scrapie was detected in Austria about four weeks ago .
Scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food .
The disease is always fatal .
As there is no vaccination , farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie .
Even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings , the connection with BSE has still not been clarified , as I have already said .
As a farmer myself , I am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk .
I am in favour of preventive measures , starting with feeding which is suitable for the species , rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out .
I therefore welcome the Commission ' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Böge ' s report on measures to prevent TSE diseases is based on the proposals of the European Parliament ' s temporary BSE Committee .
I would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the Commission ' s proposal .
I do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s report from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is featured in the plenary session .
In the previous speech Mrs Schierhuber said that scrapies is an insidious disease .
It is indeed .
I wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease .
The possibility , if necessary , of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement , as there really is justification for it .
The inspections must be seen as being fair and cost-effective action to promote the wellbeing of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the EU .
Mr President , I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur .
There is no doubt that Mr Böge and the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment are now tremendous experts in this field .
It is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of Parliament because it is extremely important .
Regardless of the many other concerns we may have , BSE has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved .
It is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem .
I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will , I hope , address this situation .
We must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future .
No-one would want to see what happened to farmers with BSE happen ever again .
We have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work .
It is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it .
BSE has certainly not gone away .
You can see it in different countries .
I do not want to point the finger at any particular country , but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the United Kingdom .
It will be there for some time to come .
We have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , is part of that confidence-building mechanism .
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future .
It was never the responsibility of the farmer , it was the food compounders who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again .
Mr President , I am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission , namely combating TSEs .
I should also like to thank Mr Böge for his work on this issue .
Considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation under Article 152 of the Treaty on the prevention and control of TSEs .
This proposal addresses all TSE risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain .
I am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive Community system for the control of these diseases .
I have been informed that you welcome this initiative , as appears from your contributions this afternoon , to formulate a single text .
I am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation , especially after the reference made by Mrs Roth-Behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue .
I look forward to receipt of that document , which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Community policy in the field of water
- ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty-first century .
Climate change , global resources , river quality and groundwater aquifer quality are major challenges which threaten our common future .
To support this statement , I would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague , Mário Soares , in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans .
When talking about climate change , we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere .
Yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet .
Furthermore , Europe has signed international conventions , in particular the OSPAR Convention in which it made certain commitments .
The European Union ' s water policy is not starting from zero .
Many directives have already been adopted . Furthermore , the Commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives .
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation .
However , at first reading this House insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made , like OSPAR , but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs .
In many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts .
I am stressing this point because , when disasters are being reported daily in the news , we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that Europe did not act when it should have done .
Then , in our haste , we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time .
It is also clear that if we do nothing , our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner .
Even now , the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism .
To conclude , the issues are clear at this second reading .
Do we or do we not want standards compatible with OSPAR , in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero ?
Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive ?
Do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water ?
Do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples ?
The majority of the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection meet these objectives . I hope they will be supported by this House .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us , especially as the very source of life for human beings .
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources , of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe , especially in very dry regions .
A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament , the European Commission and the Council of Ministers .
We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77 , but another 30 have been added .
You see , there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different . Some want tighter legislation , some want more clarification , others want to serve national interests .
Even within my group , the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , there were , of course , differences of opinion .
Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions .
In this sense , the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position .
Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament ' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers .
We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament ' s credibility .
For me , that includes the zero demand , i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020 .
That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings .
Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days .
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water .
The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too .
I am horrified that both Members of Parliament and the public have been misled by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter .
I therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises .
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann , for all her work and her cooperative attitude , even if we have agreed to differ on certain points .
And I also thank the representatives of the European Commission , who stood by with advice and expert help at all times .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water .
The framework directive on water is a necessary initiative .
Nevertheless , given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of European construction , this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion .
Nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us .
However , in Spain and the other southern countries , which have an unusual climate , the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures .
I am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the Spanish Socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here .
One example is water transfers .
We would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to Community supervision .
In Spain , a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of Europe .
We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment .
However , an environmental Europe cannot , in any circumstances , be built at different speeds , but must be built from a point of view of solidarity .
Mr President , the ecological disaster in the Danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of Europe are and how important water is to us all .
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe .
This brings home the connections which bind us together .
This framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details .
It is important for us to remember that this is a framework .
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad .
It is easy for individual countries , for individual sectors of industry , to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days .
There are many opportunities to hide .
The reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in daughter directives in months and years to come .
That is the time to debate some of these problems of detail .
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation .
I would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not broadcasting to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing .
This is something that they prefer to avoid doing .
The principle also concerns water charging .
I want to refer to the political position here .
The common position has weakened the stand taken by Parliament at first reading .
Some of the NGOs would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless . It is a retrograde step .
This is an opportunity for us to improve the situation .
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation .
We have seen vote after vote lost .
Measure after measure has come out of the Environment Committee . We have failed to achieve a qualified majority .
Our attempt to improve the environment of Europe has failed .
We need to get into that conciliation position .
We need , at the end of the day , to ensure that we end up with a sensible , balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as long as nearly thirty years ago , the European Commission made attempts to draw up a European water policy .
A hundred and twenty-nine chemical substances had to be regulated .
Eventually , standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances .
The unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle .
Some seven years ago , it still looked like the European water policy was going to be sacrificed on the altar of subsidiarity .
This sentiment is partly reflected in the common position which came about under British Socialist Presidency .
That position is like holey cheese , or to keep it the sphere of water , as leaky as a sieve .
It explains the ground swell of amendments which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment : nearly one hundred amendments for the second reading .
This is unusual , but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes .
The dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak .
The chemical industry and , unfortunately , the European Commission and the Council of Ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance .
This is very time-consuming , and , more importantly , there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances .
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable . This is what is meant by the term " close-to-zero " .
The Commission already has a list of 32 priority substances , many of which have a hormone-deregulating effect .
These are so-called endocrine disrupters and cause , even in extremely minimal quantities , changes in the gender of animals and even humans , as is more and more being ascertained by scientists .
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close-to-zero by the year 2020 .
I would like to mention two substances from the Commission ' s list : mercury and tributyl , abbreviated to TBT .
On the bottom of the Wadden Sea , the values of mercury and TBT are higher than the OSPAR value , to wit , ten and one thousand times , respectively .
The chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by harmless substitutes , and if this is impossible , to apply them in closed systems .
For the substance TBT , this means that it can no longer be used as an anti-fouling substance .
A sound alternative would be to clean the ship ' s sides mechanically .
Mr President , the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the Water Directive .
The Council 's common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas .
Therefore , our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete .
As members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals .
Firstly , we think that the time-frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the Council .
We therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive .
Secondly , I should like the phasing out of noxious materials to be carried out consistently .
There should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented .
The legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions , such as the OSPAR Convention must be respected .
Thirdly , we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy .
This means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used .
Nowadays , taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming .
The obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay , although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases .
Fourthly , we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined .
Fifthly , the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear .
Against that background , our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by Mrs Lienemann , the rapporteur , as adopted in committee .
As regards pricing policy , there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report .
My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43 , tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens ' Amendment No 105 .
I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned .
However , some people in our political group think otherwise .
Consequently , Amendment No 107 , on the same question , has been tabled by one section of our group only .
On the whole , I welcome the committee 's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann 's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise .
Mr President , every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet , yet the abundance of water is an illusion .
The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders .
Water is a renewable but limited natural resource .
It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable .
In the EU , this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas .
We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water , given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land .
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive .
We are not , fortunately , at this point .
However , we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods , which the directive underlines .
For example , France , the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding .
We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other .
Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water .
The water issue will definitely not be settled today . In fact , the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects .
Mr President , it is very likely that , during this century , good-quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil .
This is enough reason to thank Mrs Lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water .
It seems rather complicated to attain a proper European legislative framework .
With the framework directive on water policy , we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the EU ' s water legislation .
But that has not dismissed us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies .
More specifically , the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by Member States and water boards , which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach , need to be maximised .
As far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned , I am of the opinion that the Councils ' objectives lack both commitment and ambition .
The Committee on the Environment ' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close-to-zero is , in my view , to be welcomed and worthy of emulation .
However , a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability .
Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced , as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control , and which pollute the water quite substantially .
Mr President , we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect .
In the 20th century , water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances , special waste , chemicals and so on . And we can already see the consequences !
We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation .
The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here .
Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources , it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements .
Mr President , it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz , assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher , put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety .
It is not an easy topic and , in my opinion , the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed .
The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage .
The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result , we have been able to draft important , more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading .
In fact , the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal .
It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge .
I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail .
I would first of all like to focus on quality .
The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy .
A very important component , to wit , one third of our drinking water , is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands .
The Netherlands is located downstream , in a delta , which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance .
Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality .
In a number of amendments , the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question .
I would now like to say a few words on quantity management .
In his poem " Herinneringen aan Holland " [ " Reminiscing about Holland " ] , a famous Dutch poet mentioned water too , which , with its never-ending trail of destruction , was feared and respected .
In 1953 , we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology .
When our rivers flooded in 1990 , we established that installing artificial works upstream affects the water-storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage .
This means that in terms of quantity management too , we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it .
Mr President , I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work .
Water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right .
Everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self-evident , as many have experienced in Southern Europe and are experiencing now in the Danube countries too .
Water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples .
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination .
We need to recognise that water is a joint liability .
Cooperation within a catchment basin must be self-evident .
Too little operational capacity upstream or , in fact , excessive use , can cause problems downstream .
Coordination is the key word here .
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical .
Changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on precipitation .
Some areas are becoming drier , whilst many are becoming wetter .
It is time for action .
In March , the Second World Water Forum will be held in The Hague .
This Forum stands for a worldwide vision .
This vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control .
The time for action is upon us .
The European Parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time .
But we should not lower our standards too much either .
The common position is not ambitious enough .
This is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements , or the OSPAR objectives .
We need to aim for dangerous substances to be phased out by 2020 .
This has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too .
The OSPAR objectives are now being drawn up .
A list has been compiled , containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment .
It is both technically and economically possible to reduce the emission of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again .
Needless to say , the directive also needs to be binding .
Countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives .
Quality has a price , but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future .
Mr President , Commissioner , my compliments to Mrs Lienemann on her excellent work on the Water Directive .
We should also recognise that , in Europe , our fresh water sources may be said to be on the borderline between being owned by everyone and by no-one .
It is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established .
It is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are , irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common watercourse .
However , I have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation .
I also hope that the vote will not be a washout and that will depend on what I see as two quite fundamental points .
First OSPAR .
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough ; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment .
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough .
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR .
Only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and , more importantly , objectives which are enforceable under the law .
Anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters , such as those which have just come to light in Romania and Hungary , from happening to us .
I find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection , despite having agreed internationally on OSPAR .
But I think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in Parliament , in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised .
It is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth .
Water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the OSPAR convention .
With closed production circuits this is possible ; anything else would water down the directive .
Let us grab our chance .
I know that this directive may have problems , given the differing situations of the various countries of the Union , as has already been mentioned .
The situation in the north is different from that in the south , and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas .
I understand this .
There are also difficulties with the issue of transfers .
However , Mrs Lienemann ' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water .
Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report .
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament , coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water , I support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive .
However , I would now like to look at the areas of difference between Parliament 's Committee on the Environment and the Council .
The latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter .
I see no reason why European Union Member States cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible .
I now turn to the amendments to be tabled before Parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage .
The Council in its common position states that the European Union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage .
No specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position .
Amendment No 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in Europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently .
Moreover , an adequate contribution from different economic sectors , broken down into industrial , household and agricultural sectors , must ensure that this policy is implemented .
Unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that metering and water rates should be implemented for households right across the European Union states .
This is politically impractical from an Irish perspective , as indeed it would be from the perspective of other EU Member States such as Portugal , Greece and Spain .
Mr President , I want first of all to say thank you to Mrs Lienemann for her report .
It is here and now that we decide to what extent the EU countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come .
We can do this by , as a Parliament , amending the Council ' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment .
In its unaltered form , the present directive could , in fact , have very unfortunate and long-term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water .
It would be to send out the wrong signals both to European industry and to the European people .
It is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters .
The directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100,000 chemicals in circulation .
We cannot afford to wait .
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment .
The EU ' s Ministers for the Environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the OSPAR Convention , which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment .
This Convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and , not least , to our descendants .
Mr President , it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive .
The Treaty of Amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention , for the implementation of the ' polluter pays ' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment .
This situation is loudly echoed in many sectors of the economy , and especially in the agricultural sector .
We can achieve this long-term objective by developing measures with demanding standards .
This directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting .
First there is wide information for and involvement by the public , a rarity in a European directive .
Secondly , there is compulsory cooperation .
Thirdly , I should like to address the question of the timetable .
I am firmly convinced that we need a strict , tight timetable in order to work towards our long-term objective .
Compare it with what happens in December .
We all know in December that Christmas Eve falls on 24th December and we start buying presents .
But what would we do if we knew in December that Christmas was in thirty years ' time .
We all know what we would do , which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy .
I emphatically support the rapporteur ' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive , from the list of measures to the question of employment measures .
May I take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the Nitrates Directive have still not been implemented in all Member States , in spite of the fact that there is a common EU resolution .
The present proposal tightens up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives .
It is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced synthetic substances .
This cannot be done , and it also , in any case , goes against nature .
European agriculture would not , for example , be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread .
As a result , agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU , with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs .
I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , water is a precious raw material .
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal .
It should , therefore , not surprise us that water is the cause of wars .
The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs .
General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation .
Europe is therefore facing an arduous task ; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation .
I have to admit that in Flanders , where I come from , we still have a long way to go too .
We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter .
Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way .
The common position is in this respect a farce , a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements .
The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years .
By then , my children will be older than I am now .
You have to admit : this is a joke .
I would like to finish off with this observation .
In the past couple of months , we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium .
What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers .
In our own country , this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations .
They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament ' s more drastic positioning .
I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware .
Ladies and gentlemen , fine words are no longer sufficient .
We need to change tack completely .
During the vote tomorrow , we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy .
This can only benefit our credibility .
The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform : the issues at stake .
This morning , in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi , many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions .
Yet it is not just a question of who does what , as one of you said very clearly and forcefully .
Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do .
We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future , particularly with the countries which will be joining us .
We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament .
We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work .
We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments , local elected representatives , non-governmental organisations , socio-professional organisations and the media .
The Commission will propose that the Member States become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership .
We are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the European Union Presidency and the European Parliament .
I have indicated the conditions under which the Commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits .
We want to encourage debate among the people .
So this is what we are going to do . We will have a budget of approximately EUR 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve .
We will launch this dialogue on 8 March in Brussels in the presence of 700 young Commission stagiaires .
That is all I have to say for the moment .
I welcome any questions , suggestions or proposals from the Members present .
Colleagues , you know the rules .
You are expected to ask questions , not necessarily make lengthy statements .
You have one minute each in which to ask your question .
Mr President , I think I also speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that I chair , in expressing my appreciation of this Commission initiative .
Moreover , this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by Parliament itself in its resolution of 18 November .
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier ' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme .
Thank you , Mr Napolitano . I can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 November .
I understand your concern , Mr Napolitano , and an interinstitutional working group will be set up .
Its first meeting should take place in March .
You realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is music to my ears to hear you use the word ' citizen ' so often .
We are increasingly concerned in this House about public opinion .
The fear of public opinion is a rather paternalistic concept but our House is what it is and we must do what we can with it .
As you know , there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , the day before yesterday , there was a leading news item in the most popular Danish news programme , which I would ask you to comment on .
Will you confirm what is the case ?
Mr Haarder , to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing .
My personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the Austrian people , businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in Austria of a new government coalition .
Therefore , subject to verification which I or someone else will give immediately after this sitting , I can confirm what you have just said , that the Commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort .
Commissioner Barnier , you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe .
With reference to the IGC , as you know , under the Helsinki decisions the Portuguese Presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the IGC during the course of the IGC .
Clearly , Parliament has its own representatives present , Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos .
Mr Beazley , my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise .
I will perhaps say this differently from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that , in many cases , we will say this together .
This is why I congratulate Mr Napolitano ' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the Fifteen and the European Parliament .
Having said that , the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions .
I will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year .
Mr President , firstly I would like to compliment the Commission on its approach .
I have two questions . Firstly , you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission .
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well , that is to say via the television and Internet ?
My second question is of a critical nature .
The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency .
My question is really : how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC , because the present directive is not a good example of this .
Mrs Maij-Weggen , given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC , it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now .
The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible .
The documents will in the main be open working documents .
The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised .
These are the modern means to be used .
However , I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people .
Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal , I want a Commissioner , when he can , an MEP , a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe .
I have evidence that this is possible . The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions .
Mr President , I welcome Mr Barnier ' s commitment to go to the regions , both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say .
I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire , a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding .
He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner .
I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign ?
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be .
That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist .
The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign .
Mr Corbett , thank you for your comments .
I willingly accept your invitation .
If I have understood you correctly , you want me , when I come to Yorkshire , to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds .
I can perform this dual task .
I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments , as I have already done , not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ .
Ten days ago I was in Westminster , so you can see , Mr Corbett , that I am not afraid of the difficulties .
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin .
I have already appeared before the French Senate .
Therefore , throughout this debate , whenever I can , I will go directly to see the national parliaments too .
With regard to the dialogue with our citizens , it is not a question of propaganda or marketing , nor even of communication .
Mr President , I should like to join Mr Barnier ' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with .
It is not much fun , of course , having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself .
Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States ' election processes ?
It is , of course , these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments .
Can such matters be controlled from Brussels ?
Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning ?
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe , Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears .
Do you believe that these proposals , or proposals of this type , form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki ?
I do not think so .
Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion , unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking ?
In terms of social protection , I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology .
In your country , Mr Bonde , like everywhere else , I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people .
This will therefore be our rule .
I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues .
I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical .
Mr MacCormick , I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals . It must get as close as possible to the people , where they live and where they have their roots .
We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions .
Mr Berthu , the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this .
It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam .
It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies .
The Commission is acting correctly if , on a particular point , it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions . I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7 .
Everything which can be done will be useful . I am sure that you and I , Mr Berthu , can at least agree on this .
Thank you , Commissioner .
You have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for Europe that you referred to .
You have set a very good example of time-keeping today .
That concludes the debate .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0009 / 2000 ) .
We will examine questions to the Commission .
First part
Question No 36 by ( H-0025 / 00 ) :
Mr President , the Commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in Kosovo , not just for pregnant women but across the board .
This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it .
The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable .
However , the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population .
The Commission ' s response has been as follows : firstly , the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding .
ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care , on support to institutions as well as vaccination .
However , efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province .
UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field .
Secondly , under the reconstruction programme , urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme .
Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city .
However , the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project .
We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation .
Under the European Community ' s damage assessment , estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million .
The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds .
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system .
The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement .
Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise .
Besides , Commissioner , is so-called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in Kosovo ?
Do you think that so much inaction is excusable when , on the continent of Europe itself , the right to life is at risk ?
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that .
Of course , she is entirely correct in saying that the Union ' s credibility is on the line with what happens , not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole .
I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance .
I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines .
As a result of that , a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society .
So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment .
Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities , or before the hostilities , tragically killed their own children .
We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo .
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour , but it is not going to be easy .
Commissioner , I would like to thank you for your response to the Member ' s first question and the supplementary question .
However , I still have some contacts in Kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by ECHO , among others , are often of inferior quality .
In some cases , there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like .
Are you aware of this ?
Are you prepared to act upon it ?
This is my first additional question .
My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica .
You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that , given the tense situation , Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all .
What does the Commission intend to do in order to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can get to hospital ?
On the first question , I am going myself to Kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and I will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable Member about the ECHO food package .
I have not heard that suggestion before , but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there .
Secondly , I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica .
I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago , I saw the situation there for myself .
We will try to address them , but it is not easy .
Question No 37 by ( H-0029 / 00 ) :
The Commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries .
In the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey , as well as the one between Armenia and Azerbaijan could be opened without settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict .
Mr President , the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union .
My question therefore is this : will the Commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions ?
The key issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk group to find a settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can .
We have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the TACIS programme to Armenia .
Let me relate my answer specifically to the question of Turkish accession to the European Union .
The situation of Turkey 's relations with its neighbours will , as the honourable Member asks , be closely examined in the framework of the pre-accession strategy .
As stated in Agenda 2000 - and I quote : " Enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts " .
That statement could not be much clearer .
But I repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results .
Question No 38 by ( H-0040 / 00 ) :
The Commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the region .
We will , however , consider raising the matter with the Turkish authorities , together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre-accession strategy for Turkey .
I have a related point .
It concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole .
As you know , the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to Syria and to Iraq in particular .
Can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ?
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member .
We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up .
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area .
We will raise that , too , in the representations we make .
A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern , such as the effect on displaced farmers .
We thank Mr Patten for having replied on behalf of the Commission .
Question No 39 by ( H-0036 / 00 ) :
Subject : Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up .
It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century .
What are the Commission 's views on the substance of the Charter ? What type of rights will the Charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ?
Which citizens will it cover ( those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement ? Will it cover immigrants etc . ? )
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda ?
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?
What are the Commission 's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union ?
The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council .
Having said that , this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources .
However , given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government , this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis .
The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary .
Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union .
It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions .
It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail .
As I have also said before to this House , the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty .
However , we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government .
The difficult part , which will fall to the Convention , is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties .
Commissioner , it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in Europe , men and women , are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations .
We hope that this important Cologne Council decision will become a reality .
Globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other , make it urgently necessary to define those rights .
Seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the European Council in Nice will not be a wasted meeting .
In this context , the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated .
The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions , as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union .
I understand your concern about the rights of children .
Many elements of our work , and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs , involve protecting the rights of children .
This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully .
Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children .
I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention .
Mr President , I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach .
However , I should like to ask a slightly different question .
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter ?
It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process .
I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has .
Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate ?
I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights .
There is no contradiction between the two .
The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter .
I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here .
Question No 40 by ( H-0095 / 00 ) :
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria .
I am referring , of course , to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000 , the basic elements of which I would like to restate .
The Commission confirmed then , as it does today , that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency ' s statement of 1 February 2000 .
These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them .
There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider ' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements , which are also anti-European .
Secondly , the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties , specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union .
The Commission is not a State .
It cannot and must not act as if it were one .
I repeat , a " serious and persistent breach " is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State .
I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria .
I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary .
The values at stake are too central , too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises .
Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say .
In Austria ' s case , the statements are contradictory to say the least .
On the one hand , any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party .
On the other hand , the new Austrian Government ' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights .
We will soon have our first opportunity , and an excellent opportunity it will be , to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one .
I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission ' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives .
Lastly , I would like to assure you , Mr Ford , that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities , should it prove necessary .
I thank the Commissioner for his reply to my question .
But is Commissioner Vitorino aware , not only of Mr Haider 's and the Freedom Party 's words , but also of their deeds ?
Could the Commissioner answer two questions .
Firstly he talked about verification .
Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it ?
We are not talking about words here .
We are talking about deeds by the Freedom Party and Mr Haider .
Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria , as in any other Member State .
If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs , we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly .
I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament , but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations , which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission .
Regarding the situation in Carinthia , we need to look at this in detail .
The honourable Member raised the question .
The protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the Commission has put before the Council .
We should not only focus this debate on the Austrian question .
That question calls for reflection , for debate and , if necessary , for action .
Thank you very much , Mr Vitorino , for your valuable contribution to this Question Time .
Second part
Questions to Mrs Wallström
Question No 41 by ( H-0021 / 00 ) :
The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances ( lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent chrome , PVC and halogenated flame retarders ) .
A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions , the most recent of which dates from July 1999 .
Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft , which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998 ?
The Commission agrees with MEPs that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems .
Consequently , the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and , since 1997 , has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned .
The outcome of the discussions , as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area , are now being examined by the Commission .
The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are , they say , incompatible with international trade law .
The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States ' arguments .
I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter .
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft .
There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one , to my knowledge , dating from July 1999 .
Is this the text which you will be submitting , or an amendment to the original version ?
Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government .
I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible , you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation .
The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules .
Thank you for the follow-up question . It is important for me to have a chance to answer it .
The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal .
Parts of it have been strengthened , but other parts may well contain too many compromises .
We are still in the process of preparing a text , and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment .
I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations .
I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards .
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these . However , I do want to listen to all the points of view .
For example , I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal .
However , I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive .
In fact , I believe that we should be showing the way , an intention that will also characterise the final proposal .
Question No 42 by ( H-0026 / 00 ) :
Is the Commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision-making in the environmental field ?
In 1988 , the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men .
One of the programme 's aims is to develop and supervise methods , strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility .
Within the framework of the action plan , each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures . One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions .
The new Commission 's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office .
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment , where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women .
Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions .
Currently , women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts , and we hope the number will increase steadily .
Moreover , we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups .
As regards our external partners , all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes .
With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality , as you know , this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Article 3 of the Treaty states that , in all the activities referred to in this Article , the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities , and to promote equality , between women and men .
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field .
I should , of course , like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament ' s Committee on Women ' s Rights and Equal Opportunities , particularly its chair .
We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully , so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned .
Thank you for your reply . I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields .
I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes .
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work .
I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes . This is a crucial goal .
In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality , it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required .
.
( SV ) My understanding of mainstreaming is , of course , that this should characterise everything we do .
In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General , issues of equality play a very important role .
For example , I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission .
If we are to be able to motivate everybody , I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or , if you prefer , from the bottom up .
My impression of environment-related work , broadly speaking , is that in many instances it is dominated by women .
This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field .
I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention , but there is certainly room for improvement .
I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up .
I hope that this will be of benefit .
Question No 43 by ( H-0045 / 00 ) :
What is more , a very large warehouse has been constructed , in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation .
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area ?
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely , pending a review of the development plans of the area ?
The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour , but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member .
The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan .
The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive .
An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out .
The most serious harm caused by the project , the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats , was only to be temporary , and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats .
At the Commission 's suggestion , the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area , from which they had previously been excluded .
Furthermore , to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats , the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved .
However , since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute .
Firstly , the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements .
They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts .
However , the new commitment included some minor changes which , in turn , led to a further complaint .
However , it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities , particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts .
- I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said .
The mudflat at Stregrennan , which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission , has been completely destroyed at this stage .
It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives .
You say there will be no further funding .
I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation .
If not , why not ?
If you are , when exactly are you going to do it ?
Is this right and proper ?
What is your opinion on that ?
Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives .
Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed .
Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done .
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place .
As a result , the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means .
There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge .
The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities , and does not require prior Commission approval .
The Commission ' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met , and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging .
In this case , the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass .
We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds .
Mr President , sadly , the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one .
There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding .
It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future .
.
( SV ) This is a very important question .
The message contained in the joint text is still valid .
We cannot hand out money with one hand and , with the other , take countries to court , where they may well be fined .
It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy .
The result may , of course , be some difficult questions of priorities .
In that respect , Ireland falls short , like other Member States , but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results .
I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good .
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this .
You will have to discuss this outside the Chamber .
Questions to Mr Barnier
Question No 44 by ( H-0020 / 00 ) :
However , local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that ' partnership ' arrangements under the new CSF for Greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance .
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies ?
I am also saying this as a former environment minister .
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community ' s action is , as you know , one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation .
Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster .
During these visits , I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement .
As for the monitoring and management of these programmes , I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation .
Within the third CSF , this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee .
This is all I can say .
I thank the Commissioner , and do not at all question his intentions and interventions , which adopted a positive line .
However , things are really quite different .
The operation of the Community Support Framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state , government and party delirium as regards the European Union ' s funding .
I cannot show you the television programmes here but I can show you the Greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections .
There are only a few weeks to go before the elections .
This is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates , financed by the European Union , the CSF .
My question to the Commissioner is this : what is to be done ?
Will the Commission remain silent ?
Will it discuss the matter ?
Will it bring it up with the Greek Government or will we persist with the pathological situation we had with the previous Commission ?
Mr Alavanos , I see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited .
Then if it is really necessary for me to do this , I will make comments or recommendations to the Greek Government .
I would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or I will come and get them from you later on .
Having said that , I thought your question related more to the partnership issue .
Further to your questions on the pre-electoral period , I can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non-governmental organisations .
Subsequently , if I need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised , then I will do this .
I cannot do other than work with the Greek Government .
I think that my colleague Mr Alavanos will be giving all these particulars to the Commissioner so that he may be aware of them , because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting Community programmes .
What can the Commission do about that ?
However , I am obliged to respect the national authority with which I must conduct these negotiations .
Having said this , I will look at the situation objectively .
I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted , this must be remedied .
I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework .
Question No 45 by ( H-0041 / 00 ) :
Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period ?
What role will aid from the Structural Funds play , on the other hand , in the promotion of renewable energy ?
Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional , renewable energy sources ?
Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks ?
This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds , such as those listed in Objective 1 , might welcome this type of installation .
We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific ' nuclear research ' context .
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks .
Could you please give an answer on this issue ?
You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere .
Quite simply there is no question of this .
I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation .
As a result , the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected .
However , you are right to question me as this is your task , as mine is to answer you .
As has happened in the past , the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification .
I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point .
The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible .
I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks .
This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds .
Question No 46 by ( H-0052 / 00 ) :
Mr MacCormick , the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated , for the 2000-2006 period , in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds .
As in the past , these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State .
Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure , the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected .
Please excuse this very legal answer .
However , after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle .
- I am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content .
We are left with Article 11 ( 1 ) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States .
Very well : that is to be the unchanging rule .
Does section 11 ( 1 ) conceivably authorise the following practice .
Is that really authorised ?
Unfortunately I do not have time to go into depth on this issue .
I am aware of the Member ' s competence on these matters .
I also know the particular problems in your constituency in Scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects .
I will go further in the written answer which I have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely .
- Additionality is a major issue too in Wales , which I represent .
Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales .
As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality , at that time linked to the RECHAR funding .
And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland .
Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government ?
I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales .
I will verify this point and , if you wish , I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick .
Therefore , if you wish , as soon as I have this information by sector and region , I will personally send you the information on Andalusia .
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters .
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints .
I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government .
You may answer the question .
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I hear that you have a strong voice .
I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me .
I have given you my answer .
I am keen that the Structural Funds , particularly those in Objective 1 , are allocated where needed .
We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive .
I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country . I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation .
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible .
I need to know about this allocation , however , and this is why I said that I could not answer today .
As I did not have an answer , I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December .
I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it .
I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and , in this case , passionate intervention .
I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections , and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections .
It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time , since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again .
Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question : Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable ?
This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related .
Having said this , we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union .
I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain .
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens , about public debates .
The more we talk about Europe and what Europe is doing for daily life , even when we disagree , the better this will be , provided that we talk about this objectively .
I am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the Structural Funds Regulation .
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years .
For the time being , please let me apply the Regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in Berlin .
This is all I can say today .
Thank you very much for your replies , Mr Barnier .
Questions Nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing .
Question No 51 by ( H-0049 / 00 ) :
Subject : New premises for the OHIM At present the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market ( OHIM ) is still operating from the same temporary premises , even though its new building was opened in June 1999 .
In view of this unusual situation , will the Commission say why the OHIM has not yet moved to its new premises ?
The honourable Member asked a question on this topic in November 1999 and I would like to refer him to the answer given at the time .
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building .
Unfortunately , a number of deadlines have been exceeded .
A number of technical provisions need to be made , such as the installation of a computer network , archives , a canteen and furniture .
The OHIM is now in the process of arranging this and is expecting to move into the new premises by June .
During the previous question , we were discussing electoral issues .
If you had been there , I am sure you would have been ashamed .
The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present .
In the middle of an election campaign , a series of authorities , all of them run by the party in government , made clearly electioneering speeches which , furthermore , were broadcast live on television .
It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government , as well as his own work , although it was irrelevant to that event .
The opening of a building which was not finished , in the middle of an election campaign , which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied , makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous .
I would therefore like to ask you , Mr Commissioner : does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign ?
Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government ?
It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another .
As such , I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described .
I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain .
What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible .
May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference .
I hope that this building will then be occupied .
I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question .
As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons .
A year later , it is still not functioning , which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening .
We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified .
I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions .
It is , however , interested in official statements and actions .
We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d 'intention .
We are concerned with public official actions and events , rather than any possible underlying motivation .
This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question .
Also , the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual .
As far as I am concerned , all expenditure is real .
And any remaining skeletons , I intend to leave them in the cupboard .
As the author is not present , Question No 52 lapses .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 53 and 54 will be taken together .
Question No 53 by ( H-0057 / 00 ) :
Subject : Swedish derogation regarding the import of alcoholic beverages At present , Sweden has a derogation until 2004 allowing restrictions on alcoholic beverage imports .
The Swedish Government and a large percentage of the Swedish people want the derogation to be extended on public health grounds .
What is the Commission 's position on the Swedish derogation concerning these imports ?
Question No 54 by ( H-0117 / 00 ) :
I would like to answer these two questions as follows .
When Sweden joined the European Union , it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States .
This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year .
Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years , as this would be necessary to protect public health .
My position on this is clear .
Sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the Union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist .
I cannot see a reason , therefore , why a further extension for this measure should be proposed .
That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time .
We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market , just like other citizens of the European Union .
This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse .
A recent study , carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund , however , has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden .
I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm , the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions .
I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week .
It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures .
Thank you for your reply .
I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission .
Instead of 2004 , it should , of course , be 1 July 2000 .
I have some sympathy with the Commission 's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally . Such a rule is only normal .
Nevertheless , I should like to ask two questions : Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations , for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations ?
My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol .
This may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole EU .
What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission 's work ?
A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market . It also has important implications for public health .
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context , then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden .
May I thank Mr Andersson for the supplement to his first question and may I answer that question as follows ?
Firstly , Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003 .
These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003 .
However , in the case of Sweden , the situation is different .
In 1995 , a five-year derogation period was decided upon , which is now lapsing .
I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period .
Secondly , the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way .
Thirdly , I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important .
I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated , namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions , the consumption of alcohol will remain the same .
The question is then , of course , where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers ?
The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves , and as Mr Andersson knows , this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity .
Well now , Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol .
But in that case , not only Sweden , but all EU countries , should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol .
We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States .
Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then ' prohibition ' .
He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States , where , eventually , prohibition was withdrawn .
All this means that we need to protect health , of course , but not by banning alcohol , because that does not work .
I gather that Mr Posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter .
As is known , this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which , in itself , is at odds with Union legislation .
Mr President , I listened with interest to the Commissioner 's reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market .
Can we now expect the European Commission to take action against the French Republic before the European Court of Justice ?
I should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable Member , since this matter is now under active consideration by the Commission .
The Commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the European Court of Justice .
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now , but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks .
I ask for the Member 's understanding for this small delay in the Commission 's decision .
Commissioner , do you have any reason , on public health grounds , for a difference in the taxation rates on , for example , Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague 's Bavarian beer ?
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe ?
The matter of excise taxes , to which the honourable Member is referring , is the prerogative of the Member State concerned .
The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products .
Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States .
It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs , which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States .
For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France , whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom .
That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom .
The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax .
The Commission has no means of influence here .
In the case of Sweden , the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol .
There is , of course , elasticity of demand , in this case a price elasticity of demand .
I am not sure exactly what it is , but it is not zero , therefore it must have some effect .
My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis , but I would like to press the point further .
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market .
We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products .
That is indeed distortion of the internal market .
If I had my way , I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe .
As a result , smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another .
But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way .
This is an area of unanimity , as Mr MacCormick knows , and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes , it will not happen .
Once again , towards the end of this year , the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes , and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine , although we do not know how much tax is put on it , but I suppose it is a lot .
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Community policy in the field of water ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy .
To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East .
In fact , a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania , threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia .
I understand that Mrs Wallström , whose presence here tonight I appreciate , is going to visit the area .
The development of this directive has been difficult and complex , involving diverse interests and divided opinions .
I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature , Mrs Lienemann , has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions , and has succeeded to a large extent .
However , it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations .
I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain .
The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity , century after century , year after year , day after day , and is still doing so today .
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010 .
I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero , or close to zero , degree of pollution .
In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution .
We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is a very important directive .
Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems .
The public must have a right to clean water .
It is important not only for the environment but also for public health .
I am not speaking so much for myself , as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home .
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality .
Action must get under way immediately .
We cannot afford to waste time .
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one .
It is a question of doing what is technically possible ; obviously it is not possible to do anymore , but we must be sufficiently ambitious .
I would like to comment on one issue , which was spoken about earlier .
I believe the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , congratulations , Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work .
Water and air surround us everywhere .
We share them with everyone on this earth .
Water is a prerequisite for human life . And there are more and more of us in the world .
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal .
Nothing could be further from the truth !
It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so , too , the conditions for life .
It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources .
I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order .
Mr President , we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann , the targets it sets and the directive under discussion .
However , we should look a little more closely at some points .
I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place , the specifications common to us all must be very stringent .
I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding , because , at the end of the day , that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy .
Mr President , here we have what is basically a good measure .
It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management .
Its aim of good-quality water for drinking , for wildlife , the environment and economic purposes is right .
The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood .
We have three outstanding problems .
The first is the transfer of water between basin areas .
That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain , Ireland and the United Kingdom .
Secondly , we have to have realistic targets , but targets nevertheless .
Looking at Amendment No 7 , for example , which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances , you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic .
Also , some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English , that is quite a meaningless term .
We need to look very carefully at those .
The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better .
Thirdly , I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky .
Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky , which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream .
Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk .
That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole .
In that spirit , we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos .
River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought .
Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action , which during the directive ' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business .
Mr President , first and foremost , I want to say that protection of the aquatic environment , both surface water and groundwater , is probably one of our most important duties of all .
We are all entitled to clean drinking water .
I should like to express my great appreciation of Mrs Lienemann ' s work on this matter .
It has been a huge task , and I should like to express my support for all of Mrs Lienemann ' s amendments . These are all improvements to the common position .
Moreover , I shall only highlight the most important ones .
First and foremost , I think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years .
I also think it is important that we should put pressure on the Member States to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position .
In this regard , too , I think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate .
If this cannot be adopted as the objective , then I am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020 .
I think that Mrs Lienemann ' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive .
First of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act .
The cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come .
The event proves that in some countries applying for EU membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the EU .
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water .
In Finland surface waters are very clean .
The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves .
The process does not require a chemical sewage plant .
The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work .
Deviating from the Council ' s common position , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water .
This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed .
The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts .
The work should , of course , be regulated and subject to license in the future too , but the same rules cannot apply to , for example , Finland and Greece , which suffers from drought .
Mr President , Commissioner , water is a precious natural asset , a vital necessity , and it is our duty to protect it .
I must say , however , that , there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water , and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way .
There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water , and that should be taken into account by this directive .
In recent years , climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain .
We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled , whose aim is to improve it .
However , we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water , granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers .
In addition , amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage .
The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought , I think , to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it .
In spite of these remarks however , I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained .
However , it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted .
I would still like to highlight this point though : this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State ' s territory against its will .
I am aware , and the previous speaker highlighted this , that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water .
I believe that every one of us , in every country , could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way .
This applies to every country .
Mr President , Commissioner , we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading .
However , I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality , it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings .
Firstly , I believe that this directive is excessively tough , simplistic and reductionist .
I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court . This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission .
In the same way , this damage and these tragedies which are happening , as in Romania , are not the problem of the legislative , but of the executive and of the governments .
Furthermore , it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas , climatic diversity , desert areas and arid areas .
That is how the common position has been worded .
The same can be said with regard to transfers .
Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth , of solidarity between peoples and territories , because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less .
Lastly , I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact .
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read , and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice , rather than just laying down doctrine .
Mr President , through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union .
Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments .
A 25-year roll-out for legislation , for example , is hardly acceptable .
We have no difficulty with the " polluter pays " principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial , commercial and agricultural level .
We must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly .
The introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in Ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977 .
Meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts , to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements .
The whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the EU .
Water is a scarce and precious natural resource .
Ideally , I would like Amendment No 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on Article 9 would hold on water charges .
All legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance .
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world .
These include , for example , costs and transfers .
With regard to costs , I would like clarification of what costs we are talking about .
Are we talking about the distribution and sourcing of water ?
Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks ?
Are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services ?
Or are we talking about large-scale hydraulic works and reservoirs ?
All these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector .
Transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas .
Is the Commissioner aware that our country has one of the oldest systems of transfers in Europe ?
They already existed in ancient times : they had them in Roman times , although on a smaller scale .
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years , almost 30 years , has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year .
The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200 .
We cannot be accused of bad management .
We are not doing a bad job of management .
We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it .
I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies , because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive .
Take good note : in this diverse Europe , which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation , we have to find diverse solutions , not single solutions .
I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission , the Council and this House so that , when voting , they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required .
Commissioner , Andalusia is not Lapland .
.
Water is one of our most important natural resources , as many speakers have already said .
An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe .
Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office .
I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament .
Many of them are based upon the very constructive , informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading .
Most of Parliament ' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious .
The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .
Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary .
With a view to these forthcoming negotiations , I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position .
Firstly , I should like to mention some of my most important arguments .
We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention .
Rather than make these objectives legally binding , we must consider their political nature . This is also reflected in many of Parliament ' s amendments .
Where water charges are concerned , the present directive will constitute Europe ' s water policy for the next three decades .
It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource .
In the course of the debate , many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed .
I just want to emphasise this further .
It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them . This is also expressed in Recital 14 .
Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that , in common with my Scottish colleague , he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again .
We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production .
Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail .
Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives .
I am glad to see that Parliament ' s amendments have focused upon this .
The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text .
We must , however , keep to their precise scope and content .
As I said , their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character .
It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable .
It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables .
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6 , 10 , 14 , 24 , 58 , 60 and 88 .
The Commission cannot , on the other hand , approve Amendment No 19 , in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR .
The Commission ' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances , and so no definition is needed .
Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106 , these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR , and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments .
The Commission can also , in principle , approve Amendment No 60 , according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission ' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances .
Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed .
This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot , therefore , be approved .
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved .
Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances .
I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector .
The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive .
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services .
I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way .
I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs . I can therefore partly , and in principle , approve Amendments Nos 43-46 , together with Amendment No 85 .
I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector .
This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured .
I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105 , which is in line with the Commission ' s original proposal .
I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources .
We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals .
This must not , however , be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution .
We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question .
I agree with Parliament that the common position ' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced .
The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years .
Amendment No 28 , cancelling the third extension period , is an important step in the right direction . This proposal can therefore be approved .
A period of ten years , as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26 , among others , is , on the other hand , too short .
The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water .
This applies to Amendments Nos 6 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 78 , 80 , 102 and 104 .
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found .
To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29 , to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension , would be going too far , and these cannot be approved .
Another important area is protection of the groundwater .
We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution .
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring .
The most important parts of Parliament ' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle .
The new definition in Amendment No 72 is , however , too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose .
I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution .
Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater .
The proposal cannot therefore be approved .
The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality .
Instead , we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area .
The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled .
This part of Amendment No 41 cannot , therefore , be approved .
The Commission appreciates Parliament ' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role .
This approach and its scope , which the Commission can in principle approve , are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47 .
In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality , we wish , however , to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision .
The transfer of water is already covered by controls , but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer .
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can , therefore , be approved .
It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted .
The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned .
These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot , therefore , be approved .
The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal .
To summarise , the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .
Finally , I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views .
Important progress has been made , and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions .
A number of obstacles remain , but I am convinced that , as the legislative work progresses , we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of .
Parliament ' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious , European water policy for the next three decades .
I would like to hear the Commissioner 's view on Amendment No 45 .
I may have missed it in the list she gave out .
. I accept that .
Thank you , Mrs Wallström .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 p.m.
Financial instrument for the environment ( LIFE )
Despite the enlargement which has already taken place , when we renewed the first LIFE programme to move on to the second , despite enlargement , the level of appropriations remained the same .
It must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the Community budget .
Patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement .
I would stress the LIFE-NATURE strand in particular .
We are well aware that , in the European Union , a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation .
With LIFE-NATURE we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility , the validity of the objectives of these directives , and their capacity to be implemented .
And , for want of appropriations , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these European directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop .
But we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the European Union ' s financial programmes and instruments .
Let me point out that Parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations , not a vast sum in the Community budget , and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus .
I feel , at any rate , that for the ultimate application of LIFE , at least , there would be some way for the Union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment .
Let me conclude with the matter of our institutions ' way of working .
I would , however , like to point out that the Council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date .
As for us , we our bound by the terms of the texts : a maximum of four months .
Mr President , it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the Council and the Commission , and I will refer to this later on .
It is equally true , however , that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering LIFE I and LIFE II .
Thirdly , the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of LIFE-Environment ' s priorities is an extremely positive step .
In spite of all its virtues though , LIFE III ' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument ' s impact , which is its budget .
We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice .
Firstly , LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union .
There is no other such policy .
Secondly , LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results , and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation .
Thirdly , the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand .
Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue , however .
Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , LIFE is the European Union ' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment .
That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions , ambitions for which , of course , there is a price .
Obviously , the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III . The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004 .
This is not enough . The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million .
The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure .
Quite the opposite , it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded .
A drop in the ocean , I might say , in comparison with Europe ' s structural policies .
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998 .
A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated , and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project .
In matters of the environment , investment and ambition come in a variety of forms , and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term .
This is the price of the future of generations to come .
I shall therefore reiterate that , as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly , LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union ' s policy on the environment .
This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe , which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States .
This financial instrument is , furthermore , deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations .
That is why , ladies and gentlemen , I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE .
Through the associations , then , LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly , and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community .
Several million NGO members - millions , I say - recognise in LIFE the Union ' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage .
I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies .
Let us not forget that , to date , LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum , i.e. scarcely 0.1 % of the budget of the European Union .
For the record , the budget for agriculture , which has a real impact on the environment , amounts , as we all know , to EUR 37 billion .
The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those .
Mr President , the European Union environmental programme , to which a considerable amount ( EUR 613 million ) has been allocated , gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds .
We are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows .
Firstly , to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to LIFE funds exclusively to public bodies , subsequently , following invitation to tender , to entrust the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations .
It is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions , since private law associations may disappear or resell acquisitions .
It is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100 % public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership , even under cover of environmental protection .
Secondly , to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of LIFE funds , in order to rule our any suspicions of clientelism or ostracism .
Thirdly , to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite .
Result : a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself .
This is the sort of thing that we want to avoid .
Four , to include representatives of Parliament in the monitoring committee , at least one Member per political group .
What could be fairer than for Members of Parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for ?
Fifthly , to publish an annual scientific , technical and financial assessment of LIFE operations carried out .
Six , to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis .
Furthermore , it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent .
I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission , since the evaluation , control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects .
However , I would like to insist on certain points .
Firstly , its continuity , which , in principle , I am not questioning .
Secondly , the financial contributions .
Sadly , only 7.2 % of the projects requested receive funds .
Of the EUR 1 919 million requested , only EUR 784 million have been granted .
Now the financial statement shows only EUR 613 million to cover more countries and competences .
Parliament has proposed EUR 850 million , but the document repeats the initial proposal of EUR 613 million .
Commissioner , our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas , while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing .
Is this not a contradiction ?
Let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves ?
Commissioner , we must be consistent .
Mr President , LIFE has been the principal instrument available to the Community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy , both within the Community and in the surrounding third countries .
On the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years , an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument .
In the second , LIFE-Environment strand , which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium-sized enterprises and local government agencies , the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed .
As regards the financing package for the implementation of LIFE over the next five years , I wholeheartedly support the increase from EUR 613 million to EUR 850 million proposed by the rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann .
Besides , we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the Union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries .
What has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the Danube and its tributary has been instructive .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment , ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening .
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic .
So I will simply appeal to the Commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue .
For five years , I have been the representative of the Committee on the Environment in a regional organisation , which assuredly does not have Parliament ' s broad perspective .
The environment is in a parlous state .
Like a number of previous speakers , I , too , wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects , which , in my view , should be incorporated into the pubic domain .
As regards funding , EUR 613 million is not enough .
Even EUR 850 million is not enough .
However , the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking .
EUR 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me , is not enough , in practical terms , to allow any type of project to be carried out .
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established .
But creating parks with very limited financial resources , without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual .
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention .
I would again thank the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter .
As a result of this , I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
The Commission welcomes , above all , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 13 , which apply to the Committee procedures .
In these cases , Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position .
The Commission can , in principle , also approve Amendment No 4 which ought , however , to be introduced into another place in the text .
The Commission nonetheless considers that , if this is stated separately , then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas .
There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research , Technical Development and Demonstration .
The present programme ' s key measures - water quality , tomorrow ' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions .
Where the question of the budget is concerned , I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position .
I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential .
This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget .
The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not , however , tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000 .
Allow me also to add that , if the budget is increased , greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with .
Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure .
At this stage , the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position .
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project , more resources would , moreover , be required than are available in the present situation .
Nor can the Commission approve Amendment No 14 , which is contrary to the Commission ' s right of initiative .
With regard to the discussion concerning the deadline , I want to say that the final date for beginning to implement LIFE - 31 March 2000 , as set in the common position - must now be moved forward .
The date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted .
Finally , I want to repeat that I am convinced that LIFE will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the Community ' s environmental policy .
Parliament has contributed greatly to improving this instrument .
Thank you , Mrs Wallström .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Modernising social protection
Mr President , the issue of social security systems is an important one .
This is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU . The basis is monetary cooperation , which has since been followed up by macro-economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy .
It is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems .
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another .
Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment . It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision .
But the reverse is also the case : a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth .
In other words , social security is a factor of production .
Social security systems differ from one EU country to another . This is largely due to historical factors .
The labour market is also changing . Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers .
Another challenge is presented by technical development .
We must meet these challenges together .
The Commission ' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared , a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced .
What is more , the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment .
This is good , but it is not enough .
We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process . Clear guidelines and indicators are required .
At the same time , the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans .
We are creating a common model , but retaining the principle of subsidiarity .
This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period .
Like the work on employment , the Commission ' s proposal is founded upon four pillars .
These are : to make the systems employment-friendly ; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term ; to promote social integration ; and to guarantee sustainable , high-quality health and medical care .
All this is important .
In our report , we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area .
Equality has no pillar of its own . There , it is mainstreaming which applies .
All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality .
This is something we have borne in mind .
These proposals favour women especially .
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme .
Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union , partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping .
The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement .
We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee .
We had a lot of amendments , but succeeded in agreeing upon a report .
Now , the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen . This indicates that we have a broad consensus .
A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading , and these I shall reject .
I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members , because I do not think that these add anything to the report .
On the other hand , my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party . I think this proposal is a good one .
Certainly , it resembles Amendment No 1 , but Amendment No 14 is better .
Finally , I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade . The EU is also a union for employment and social justice .
In creating a citizens ' Europe , social policy has an important role to play .
By means of this report , Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society .
We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy .
The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Andersson , very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion .
I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report .
Key sub-goals are : promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income ; secondly , safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable ; thirdly , promoting social integration and fourthly , guaranteeing affordable , first-rate health protection .
Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals .
The Commission ' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about European social convergence .
Macro-economic policy , employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together .
The Commission has recognised this interrelatedness .
It is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is , of course , underpinned by a sound macro-economic strategy and a sound employment strategy .
These aspects are very much interconnected .
It is , therefore , surprising that this topic has , to date , not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the Commission ' s notification constitutes a break-through in a way .
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon .
We should , of course , not get overly excited about it .
It marks the beginning , rather than the end , of a process .
Some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue .
But it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion .
The issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the European Union are quite different from one another .
The challenges are different . The levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling gently but to make steady progress nonetheless .
In this way , we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges .
The majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen .
The funny thing about the Andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape ; from this perspective it is not a pie-in-the-sky report .
It is a report which tries to give direction .
There are , however , one or two aspects about which I have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific .
I think that a number of MEPs will make reference to this .
I believe that if it were to be adopted in Lisbon in this way , Lisbon will turn out to be a success .
If it is not adopted , Lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past .
All in all , I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee for this report .
I hope that Europe , in terms of social protection , will make a step forward , taking into account subsidiarity , for without subsidiarity , this would not be possible .
Commissioner , the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance .
There have been times within this Parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward .
Within my group , it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in Lisbon .
However , we , the Parliament and , in particular , the group of the Social Democrats , want Lisbon to go one step further now .
We believe that this course of action is ambitious , yet achievable .
Needless to say , it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level .
But this new course of action is very exciting .
I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group ' s idea and we hope , Commissioner , that we can also count on your support .
Finally , we urge the European Parliament , both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process .
The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support .
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them .
We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets , which is a problem for many Member States .
If reforms are not got under way , we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy , and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security .
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda .
In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU , we often use the expression social convergence .
As liberals , we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies .
It is not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objectives .
It is , of course , a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy .
It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern .
National policy is , of course , subject to a number of common parameters . That is the case with minimum social entitlements , which are established by treaty .
So coordination and cooperation are facts of life . But convergence should be about goals , not means .
I should also like to thank the rapporteur , Jan Andersson , for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report .
I can support the report , but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste .
Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended , but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same . There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions .
I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier .
This seems to be a good thing and useful .
I also feel positive about the essence of the communication , namely the strategic approach .
We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved .
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled .
We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found .
The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security , which , we hope , will be replaced by high-level convergence .
I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union .
It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments , in fact , the majority of them , appear to be downward adjustments , the remainder being improvements .
The lion ' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans : eleven restrictions and two improvements .
In the case of unemployment benefits , we came across six restrictions and five improvements .
The reasons for adjustments are , for example , to improve employment , reduce social security expenditure , but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria .
Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries .
The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries .
All in all , both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole .
This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches .
To use a figure of speech , cappuccino is not always good for us .
The European Union ' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy .
So far , social policy has remained limited in terms of set-up and resources .
But under the influence of the free movement of employees , of the internal market and of the euro , the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated .
This has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent .
In fact , the same phenomenon occurs in tax law .
In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping , the Commission has , in my opinion , developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention .
On the one hand , binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand , programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion .
Based on a number of recommendations , reports and communications , the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials .
Indeed , expansion , globalisation , a sharp increase in the ageing population , individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable .
Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection .
With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists , I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection .
Indeed , if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition , this would also harm social protection as a production factor .
And less social protection means less purchasing power , fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees .
In respect of the super-Europeans , I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable .
The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions , rightful claimants , revenue or benefits , etc .
It is thus impossible to bring all States into line .
The path which the Commission is walking is , in fact , obvious .
It has the advantage of clarity , and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid , comparative indicators and put forward recommendations .
I endorse this view .
I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter .
Mr President , as others have done , I should also like to congratulate Mr Andersson for the report he has produced .
I also welcome the Commission 's communication .
It was slow in coming but well worth waiting for .
It could be a landmark in the development of a social Europe , providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual Member States to baulk at the steps that must be taken to implement it .
We can , and must , take the unique European social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty-first century , a century which is globalising fast .
I am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Herman Schmid will not deal with that globalising world .
To be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy , our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense , are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole .
This is not an option for us any more . It is an imperative .
European citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings .
We do not want the US model - a model which has spectacularly failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life .
What it has done is increase dramatically the number of working poor in the United States .
That is not what we want to do in Europe .
We have the traditions of solidarity in Europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things .
But we have to grasp the tools to do that .
I therefore urge that we not only implement the high-level group as proposed by the Commission but also go further and have a Luxembourg-type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is one of the social areas to which the European Union ought to pay much more attention .
This situation is particularly serious in countries such as Portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn , is the lowest in the whole of Europe .
Mr President , in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses , one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands .
As the UK business grew , we invested in more people , as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery .
The simple reason for this was that social costs in the Netherlands were just too high in comparison .
I am in favour of social protection , I am in favour of the original Commission document , but I do not want to see people priced out of jobs because social protection costs become unrealistically high .
That is why in committee I proposed some form of business impact assessment , so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account , and the EPP-DE Group supported this amendment .
But I must record that other groups , led by the PSE Group , guided by my countryman , Stephen Hughes , voted this out .
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world .
I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal , which was very well-balanced , stand unamended .
Mr President , we are unable to vote for this report .
The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe .
Social rights should determine economic choices , and not the other way around .
The European Union should proclaim one general principle , to wit , that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted .
Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator .
In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems , we need a policy of general wage increase , the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State .
In order to fight poverty , entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights .
I sincerely hope , in conclusion , that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes .
For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that .
Mr President , Commissioner , the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one .
The labour market and social protection are , in fact , two sides of the same coin , that require harmonised policies and rules .
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment , flexibility and salary discipline , then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function , and vice versa .
Until recently , the European countries fixed , it could be said in an autarkic way , the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets .
Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability .
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency , budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness .
The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot , therefore , be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade .
And therein lies the paradox .
Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence , benchmarking , modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions .
That is something we would do well to recognise .
In particular , I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model ' s approach , which is one based on solidarity .
Mr President , I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection , which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe .
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson .
I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it , but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged .
Let us not forget that , in 1999 , 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate .
In social terms , it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience , as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain .
We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes , mergers , take-overs , new technologies etc .
In my humble opinion , it is the responsibility of all European , national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion .
It seems to me , Commissioner , that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work , which is the reason why there is broader agreement , and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution .
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said .
Today , we have the statement by Mr Andersson .
I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection .
The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate .
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken .
As you know , a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency , which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June .
The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things : sustainable pension systems and social accession .
I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group .
Of course , we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness , but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment .
I think the statement ' s content makes this clear .
As many of the speakers have said , I believe a first important step has been taken .
Already at the Intergovernmental Conference , social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase , in which social policy will , to a large extent , become a European policy .
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
WIPO treaty
Mr President , we are now taking a stance on an important issue , an international agreement , which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States .
In my own country , Sweden , one of our biggest export industries is affected , namely the music and sound recording industry .
It is about artists ' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products .
It is about the WCT ( World Copyright Treaty ) and the WPPT ( World Performance and Phonograms Treaty ) .
Without protection under intellectual property law , creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed .
Forgeries are big business .
It is estimated that , in Europe alone , income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy . The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry .
There exists a special clause which requires Parliament ' s assent in two cases .
With regard to the present agreement , both these conditions are fulfilled . A new institution is being created , an assembly which , in the future , will monitor the agreement and its consequences .
The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure .
Parliament must therefore give its assent , because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence .
The future will show whether it is right , by means of this new parliamentary assembly , to reduce the Commission ' s powers regarding these issues .
Parliament cannot , in any case , at present do anything about the matter .
The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works .
It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution , sale , rental , public reproduction and the making available of works . It also creates protection for software and databases .
There are problems regarding the term " author " . For example , it has not been defined .
Another issue , which is somewhat problematic , is that of intermediate storage .
This too has not been solved . It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition .
If no definitions are provided in questions such as this , it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world , with no uniformity of approach . That would not be a good thing .
The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved , too .
Parliament cannot change these details .
We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands . Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies .
Both myself , as rapporteur , and the committee think we ought to say yes . We have here an agreement which , in spite of its defects , constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright .
We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law .
I think they should have .
However , there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs , and there needs to be .
A European patent is in the offing , and that is a good thing .
Now , the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law .
It is good for us that we have the power to do this , in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied .
In that way , we can act as a model for the applicant States .
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement .
I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission ' s officials , which has been quite excellent .
Finally , I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Cederschiöld , on her very serious work .
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation ' s treaties .
Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property .
The problem has been overcome .
Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties : the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations , performances and phonograms .
In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty ' s treatment of the right of reproduction .
It would be appropriate , however , for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences .
As regards rental rights , on interpretation of Article 9 , we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists , interpreters or performers , only if this is laid down by national legislation .
I think this conflicts with Article 13 .
To conclude , I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights .
In the 21st century , the century of knowledge and the invisible economy , intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will , in many cases , be more important than traditional property .
This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe .
However , an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession , one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States , nonetheless , find too offensive .
This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy . In this connection , I expect our three institutions , Parliament , the Commission and the Council , to be in agreement .
Cultural policy means , in particular , defending the role of the arts , recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards .
Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them .
Mr President , Commissioner , the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society .
The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright , and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights .
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is , however , in addition to this recommendation , dependent on implementation by the parties themselves .
The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO .
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system .
The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted , and , furthermore , the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans .
The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe , on the contrary .
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld ' s recommendation , which is an excellent paper , but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed .
On one point of detail , I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified , for example , the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion .
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies .
If these , which technically speaking are copies , were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason .
It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser .
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user , the consumer .
The new operational environment is , above all , a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before .
It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account .
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation .
.
( NL ) Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out .
The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively .
This is important .
It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur .
I would like to present the Commission ' s conclusion to you without any further ado : it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and , therefore , with ratification by this Parliament .
I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties .
Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters , but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks .
The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them .
Consequently , approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance , because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights .
In addition , assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union ' s role in terms of copyright .
At international level , there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly . These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States , including the United States .
The developing countries , too , expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide .
In this context , Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society , which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999 .
This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties .
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300 ( 3 ) .
It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world , in the form of this recommendation .
In a nutshell , I would like to reiterate the Commission ' s conclusion here : it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , I see in the Minutes that two Members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to Strasbourg on Monday .
I would like to add that the flight from Amsterdam ' s Schipol airport was also delayed and then cancelled .
We were diverted to Basel-Mulhouse Airport .
We were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival . In fact , it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport .
We finally got here , on Monday at 8.30 p.m. , after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling .
This sort of service and difficulty in getting to Strasbourg on a Monday is quite hopeless .
I wonder if that could be added to the Minutes .
Mr President , I was booked on the same flight and I am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was KLM , our national airline company .
I hope that next time , also if any other airline company is involved , things will run more smoothly .
( The Minutes were approved )
Mr President , I would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today ' s agenda .
We decided on Monday that the Council ' s statement on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Geneva Convention was to be postponed .
I would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today , and not about the Geneva Convention .
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March .
It was erroneously included in today ' s agenda .
Mr Swoboda , I can confirm what you have just said and there is , in fact , a printing error .
The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies , because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate .
Mr President , I just want to say that , as I was walking in this morning , I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle .
The smell is absolutely disgusting !
Can you please do something about it ?
Coherence of EU policies with development
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development .
I shall , of course , give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making .
The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets .
A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged , which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments , which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies .
We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas :
Furthermore , this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries ' own policies .
A third aspect of this new model that I would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives .
The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here , as has the Bretton Woods system .
This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context .
If we are to strengthen the European Union ' s role in international development policies , we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action .
Firstly , we need to make the EU ' s development policy more effective .
As you know , an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies , and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency .
The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues .
A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more .
It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States ' national policies , which are not always complementary or well coordinated .
The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies , the central theme of today ' s debate .
As you know , a Council Resolution was approved , in June 1997 , under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports .
The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999 , and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination , notably in the fields of peace building , food safety , fisheries and migration .
But as you will also be aware , we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence , together with the communication on development policy .
Over the coming months , that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency , this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us .
By this I mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the European Union .
The second aspect that we need to consider , in relation to the coherence of policies , is development policy in the context of the Union ' s foreign policy .
There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union ' s foreign policy .
The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States ' policy .
Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States ' policies with the European Union ' s development policy .
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies , it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy .
The views of the European Parliament on this issue too , will certainly be both timely and welcome .
. Let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the EU and ACP countries .
I would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations .
I saw Member States working as a team , which was indeed a wonderful experience .
There was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over , not just because it was over , but because we all knew that we had achieved something together , the EU and the 71 ACP countries .
That is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation .
I shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement .
We explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever .
We promote participatory approaches , we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the EU .
We refocus development policies on poverty reduction strategies .
We base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country 's needs , but also of its policy performance .
We create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector .
We rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming , allowing the Community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme .
We decentralise administrative and , in some cases , financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective .
We improve the policy framework for trade and investment development .
We enhance cooperation in all areas important to trade , including new issues such as labour standards and the linkages between environment and trade .
After Seattle I am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements .
Let me turn to some of the more important points .
Firstly the agreement on political issues .
Secondly , a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law .
In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements , measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified .
Thirdly , the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption .
This is a real innovation , both in the EU / ACP context and in international relations in general .
It is thus not confined to EC activities .
This is a very important aspect , taking into account the fundability of public finances .
By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement , the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors .
Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration .
We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area .
This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999 .
The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions .
The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives , in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU , and measures facilitating their integration .
We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration .
This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons .
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance .
The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid .
We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters .
We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned .
Negotiations will start no later than 2002 .
This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries ' capacity to conduct trade negotiations .
A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations .
This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime .
Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners .
Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred , all of which will boost the ACP countries ' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy .
In addition , the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor .
They will lock in the economic reforms , just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties ' commitments under the agreements .
The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction .
Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU ' s trade regime for all least-developed countries , 39 of which are actually in the ACP group .
This process will take place in the coming five years so that , by 2005 , the LDCs ' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market .
As regards the volume of the next EDF , the EU has made its financial proposal .
It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective .
Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted .
The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances , plus the new EDF resources , over a seven-year period , that is to say , before the entry into force of the next financial protocol .
This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period .
We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity , we are moving into a period of increased activity .
Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides .
There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such , and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries .
Turning to our development policy , I would say that the global context has changed drastically .
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves .
Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned .
To focus on the input coming from the evaluations , I would mention the following problems : the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence .
This is due to the complexity of our own structures , but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States .
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments , procedures and institutional mechanisms .
Often policies are more determined by the instruments available , than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities .
Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage .
On average , to manage $ US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission , compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States .
This is a real problem : there are too many different financial instruments , each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings .
This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system .
In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament .
It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way , which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework , that is , the Council and Parliament .
The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed .
By focusing the Community 's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States .
This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado .
When we talk policies nowadays , we engage in a process of convergence .
This is part of the solution .
We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action .
Everything has become more and more complex .
This is also true of development cooperation .
It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country .
This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action .
This is where we want to go .
To identify the EC 's priority areas of support , account has to be taken of the Community 's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions .
It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework .
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up , by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement .
We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested .
Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect .
This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson .
I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF .
The problem , however , should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission ; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget .
This sermon , therefore , really belongs in the Council .
Mr President , I thank Mr Nielson .
He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention , although this is not really the topic of this morning ' s meeting .
We want to talk about coherence .
This is the topic .
This problem has been highlighted on several occasions , to whit in 1992 , in 1995 and 1997 .
The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us .
I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now .
In fact , the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997 .
In 1998 , it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements .
But what have we seen since then ?
Fine words , as is the case again today , but no report .
It is too crazy for words , really .
It is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy .
Time and time again , good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented .
It is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today .
I would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions .
A number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production .
In the Union , sugar is produced from sugar beet .
In order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive EU sugar , a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar .
The result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the Union is significantly restricted .
At the same time , we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid .
A Minister from one of the Caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me : If you just allowed our sugar access to the European Union , we would not need your development aid at all .
Another example is cacao .
The European Union intends to permit 5 % of alternative fats in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market .
This could just as well be 0 % - the internal market would still be harmonised .
By pitching the percentage level at 5 % , which is now likely to be the case , it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage .
It seems to be heading this way nevertheless .
What are we actually doing then ?
This is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what Brussels actually does ?
It seems that European industry is more important here than our own principles , our own coherences and the interests of the developing countries .
There are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes .
Why institute an oil boycott against Haiti and not against Burma , where an elected President is imprisoned , parliament has been sent home and some of the MPs have been put in jail or even murdered ?
The inconsistency is astonishing .
Here too , Mr Nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new Lomé Convention .
If the new Lomé Convention is simply put into operation , without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy , the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a biblical expression .
The Council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time : in agriculture , commerce , in conflict prevention , in the peace operations , in the fisheries sector , migration and environment .
Mr Nielson , what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy .
Once again , all your fine examples , your marvellous policy - and I include the Secretary of State in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground .
This is also at the request of the citizens .
We have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992 : this is the topic of this debate .
I hope the message strikes home and I really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures .
The topic touches the very core of the European Union .
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating .
What are the objectives which each EU policy needs to take into account ?
Mr President , these are no arbitrary objectives . These are articles , statutory articles , which form part of the European acquis established by law with which the European institutions and Member States must comply .
Every statutory article should , of course , not just be judged on its regularity , but also on the importance of its contents .
I am of the opinion - and luckily I am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens .
The interests of the citizens are only served by a credible and reliable government .
This is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society , and also important from the point of view of effectiveness , for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently .
We should not make reality out to be more rose-tinted than it really is .
Reality is obstinate .
It is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner , without any backhandedness .
The government is obliged to show up any of its dilemmas , and to show where , when and why , problems occur with coherence of policy , rather than sweeping it all under the carpet .
What we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be toyed with at leisure . Poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention .
This is a moral interest , a safety interest and is , ultimately , even in the interest of our economy .
We are all acting as if this is not really happening , but we all know that it is .
It is not our task as MEPs to adopt an ostrich policy and bury our heads in the sand .
The general interest of policy coherence is , therefore , a responsibility of the Commission as a whole , of the Council , and of the European Parliament .
What we need here is an integral approach .
This is why we urge the Commission , in this sharp and clear resolution , to develop specific instruments .
We need to pinpoint , and draw up an inventory of , the problem areas for coherence .
We need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved .
This is why I advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent .
This is why we need to set up inter-service task groups in the Commission , in the Council and in Parliament which can police the attainment of coherence .
I would wish the Commissioner all the best in his battle within the Commission and wish Mr Amado the same within the Council .
Mr President , let us be clear from the outset : when it comes to cooperation , coherence is far from being the watchword .
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but , as the previous speakers have explained so well , there are various distortions to these declarations .
The first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the Union and the Member States on individual cooperation policies .
This gives rise to serious malfunctions , because some Community programmes duplicate national programmes , whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done .
And let us not forget that the de facto neo-colonial policy of certain Member States does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop .
The second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes .
We state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to pour hundreds of thousands of euros into Swiss bank accounts via the portfolios of a number of Heads of State .
The third area of incoherence is human rights .
We say that we want to protect human rights .
We encourage developing countries to respect human rights .
We even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights .
We ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns .
And yet , at the same time , we allow the arms trade to proliferate and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti-personnel mines .
Nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations .
The fourth area of incoherence in the European Union ' s cooperation policy is this : how do you expect to help development by pillaging the natural resources of the people you are helping .
The European Union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries .
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them .
I will not even mention oil ; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as Elf and Total in Africa .
These agreements risk being extended to living organisms , which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto slavery for small-scale farmers in the south , at the hands of the multinationals .
And yet , and this is the sixth area of incoherence , we do not defend the application of the current Treaties .
The eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature .
We are always saying think globally , act locally .
And yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern NGOs at the expense of local programmes and southern NGOs .
And what about agriculture and the environment ? Still more problems , still more areas of incoherence which I might have highlighted , not to mention research , emigration or health .
In short , we claim that we want to help developing countries and , at the same time , we encourage the liberalisation of trade , which we acknowledge runs counter to that very objective .
Mr President , I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate , not just because development is in general an important issue , but because it is also a topical one .
Seattle was a failure , and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons .
The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries .
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok , and is suffering the consequences of that failure .
In the meantime , however , as has already been mentioned , the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded .
This goes to show just how topical this subject is .
We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April .
Furthermore , the recent Community budget cuts in this area , for the present financial year , are part of this trend , as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message .
He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries .
It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position , but he did indeed say this , and I heard it with my own ears .
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries .
This is a positive development in itself , especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue .
Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these .
This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions , and this is certainly true of the European Union , especially in the field of good governance and trade .
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group , which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle .
I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging , especially as regards trade , and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area .
Lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries .
We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed .
Mr President , having listened to the Council and the Commission today , I just had to look at my agenda .
Yes , it does say : ' Coherence of different Union policies with development policy ' .
But we have not heard a single word on this subject , and I find that deeply embarrassing .
We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years .
It ought to have been here in writing today and , after having heard Mr Nielson ' s speech , I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission .
I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence , and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today .
The examples are , I hope , all well known .
In any case , they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products .
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU .
This is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries , which accounts for 69 % of the total work force there compared with 1.7 % in the EU .
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34 % of the developing countries ' gross national product , compared with 5.3 % in the EU .
There is neither coherence nor human decency here .
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact ?
Mr President , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental .
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the Council .
They pointed out that the UK , France and Germany far exceed the other countries of the European Union at present in terms of population .
They then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not surrender its veto .
Is the Council discussing this issue ?
Have the UK representatives indicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration has been given to it ?
As this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this Union , surely it should receive priority consideration .
How decisions are made is all-important .
Much as I agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different Union policies and development policy , I question whether today is the time to be holding it .
However , the Council statement gave me hope for the future .
It is quite obvious to me , as someone who specialises in development policy , that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations .
I will give some examples shortly .
This was followed by a request from the Council to the Commission to provide an annual report , the first of which was to be discussed in 1998 .
We still await the first report , and that is why I believe this debate was premature , as the Commission had little to say on coherence this morning .
The areas identified by the Council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important , such as peace-building , conflict prevention and resolution , food security , fisheries and immigration .
Some of these issues have been discussed in depth .
Members of this House will have differing views , even within the same political parties , depending on ( a ) which country they come from or ( b ) which committee they sit on .
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries .
We have beef exported to southern Africa , to Namibia and South Africa , which then sell their indigenous beef to Swaziland , so that Swaziland can fill its export quota back to the European Union .
Remember too , some countries blocked an agreement with South African trade for four years .
I am not surprised the Commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development .
There is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment .
I wish the Commission well in its task of producing that basic document .
Mr President , this morning ' s debate is very important .
I therefore thank the Commission and the Council for having made a statement on the coherence of Community policies in relation to development , because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective .
However , if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy , we will end up totally frustrated and , furthermore , the result will be negative .
As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics , it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out .
The result of this absurd game is not zero , but rather a minus number , as a consequence of the material , financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise .
With regard to policy , this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another .
In today ' s globalised world , this fact is all the more obvious .
There are no boundaries for Community policies .
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied .
The Commission is addressing a very important area , that is , commercial policy .
However , this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development , agriculture , fisheries policy , immigration , our position in international financial institutions , the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform .
Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say , as some previous speakers have pointed out .
Mr President , I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and , in common with others , express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence .
But we who sit here in Parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is .
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of , in my view , useful figures .
And there is no sign of this trend ' s being reversed .
On the contrary , it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further .
In other words , there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries , including the EU countries , are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale .
In a global village , major discrepancies in the world will not , in the longer term , be tolerated by the poorest section of the village .
At some time or another , there will be a revolt , and it will be fully justified .
The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7 % .
It may well be that others are worse , but that does not place us in any better a light .
Above all , however , we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us .
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word " trade " at all .
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution .
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels , we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications .
Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries .
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and , in this connection , the EU can set the agenda , leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities .
Mr President , " The EU ' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired " .
This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week , commenting on the Union ' s development policy .
This is not new .
Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation , its effectiveness and quality have been called into question .
Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror .
Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally ?
One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy ' s internal conflict .
In terms of trade and agriculture , in particular , the European policy is in conflict with the development policy .
We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries .
This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation .
We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations , but as a policy in its own right .
I advocate transparent , joint and efficient development policy .
As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money , it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States .
Finally , I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible , so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense .
And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies , tourism , the environment , agriculture , fisheries and industry .
We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies .
So there is a whole raft of contradictions .
In my opinion , these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies .
They are , if anything , more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States .
We have to be aware of this .
For me , these are the most serious contradictions in all this , more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies .
We obviously know that , even within any one country , there are always contradictions between various policies .
That is a fact of life .
And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies , in this case development policy .
We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them .
The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one .
This monitoring centre should draw up an annual report on developments in these policies and on their impact and interaction .
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House .
That is why I consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next WTO round .
Time after time development policy is forgotten or is an afterthought when the major policies of this European Union are considered .
Take the new chocolate directive , which shows that EU countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid .
There has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries , 90 % of which are our ACP partners , estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15 % .
Take the fishing agreements , where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the EU waters .
We are , at the same time , negotiating joint ventures allowing increased access for Europe ' s large-scale fishing vessels in developing country waters at the expense of 190 million small-scale fish workers in those countries world-wide .
Take the trade agreements .
As Mr Nielson said this morning with regard to Lomé , preferential access is only for " essentially all the products of the least-developed countries " .
In other words , when EU commercial interests are concerned , poverty considerations go out of the window .
On the common agricultural policy , the biggest culprit - no development impact assessment of the Agenda 2000 CAP reforms .
Today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes .
Who will be next , quite literally , for the chop ?
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992 , its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union .
Action simply has not been taken .
That is why we want annual reports , we want an annual inter-service group and we want a complaints procedure , to make sure action is actually taken .
I ask Mr Nielson , in his summing-up , to directly address those points in the resolution .
Mr President , I would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture .
Over the past couple of years , a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and , more especially , the Lomé countries .
The results are certainly not what we expected .
What could be the cause of this ?
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries , barring a few exceptions .
I think that the Commission could do a great deal there to help this develop .
No farmer , anywhere in the world , will produce something if prices are too low .
The governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma : whom should they support , the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food ?
It should not be the case that the policy of the Member States contravenes that of the Commission .
It is up to the Commission ' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach .
Special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production .
Far too often , artificial fertiliser , veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge .
Once the project comes to an end after five years , the policy of free gifts also ends .
Finally , I wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use .
Every year , I notice in the budget of the Commission and in the European Development Fund , that they are far behind in spending the funds .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted , which is a pity .
We also note that , as before , there are still various DGs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments .
The President-in-Office of the Council came up with a good suggestion , namely to budget the European Development Fund .
Parliament would , of course , welcome this with open arms .
If this were possible , it would be a huge , historic victory .
Since Amsterdam , three terms have taken centre stage : complementarity , coordination and cohesion .
I believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields .
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council .
He stated : " Contradictions in policy can lead to balance . "
It is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand , and vice versa .
But this leads to status-quo and self-deceit , and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes , indeed , but changes which have only made poverty worse .
This is supposed to be our priority , would you believe .
I know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect .
Mr President , we have already noted that there is no report from the Commission , but I intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the Council presented in its 1997 opinion .
The first is concerned with conflict resolution .
The UN has a peace plan . We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end .
I also want to take up the subject of migration .
I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries , which might make it easier to expel immigrants , asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds .
I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms .
We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds .
Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age .
This is not because of a lack of food , but because of what we have talked a lot about today , namely increasing poverty .
Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests .
I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply , specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason .
I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce .
Women appear to be completely absent from all areas , especially development policy when , of course , we are not in reality absent at all .
Mr President , the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid .
However , the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries .
A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed .
The latter include trade , agricultural and fisheries policies .
These problems include questions of climate , health issues , biodiversity etc , and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation , that is to say the new economy which is developing .
In this economy , the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked .
The report , or survey , which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded , showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be , is naturally quite crucial .
I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more .
The Commission is new and has to be given time , but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the Commission .
I can only hope that Mr Nielsen will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the Commission .
In addition to a report of this kind , I should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character .
An analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries .
These include technology , trade , cooperation in the field of research etc . It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting .
Finally , Parliament recommends , in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution , that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence .
I believe it is only a coincidence , but the Commissioner for the Environment is also , of course , to participate in this group .
Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed .
Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other .
There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest .
Mr President , the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries , it is purely a rich country selfish interest .
Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent .
There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs , allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain .
It did not work ; poverty became worse than ever .
Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular ?
As Mr Nielson said , this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity .
Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough .
We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries .
Parliament ' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU .
It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words .
Mr President , in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence , coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States .
There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union ' s ability to match words with action .
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance , assistance to victims and related activities .
The Member States have spent similar amounts .
But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span .
Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States .
This has been talked about for years .
The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes , strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions , ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell .
It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes .
A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines .
It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational , procedural , financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union .
Are these afflictions of the past , or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations ?
Mr President , Commissioner Nielson , the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence .
For these are prerequisite to any development .
If these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance
The same goes for Cuba , Mr Modrow .
I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process .
But for this to happen , there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba .
After all , we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International .
Nonetheless , these are important criteria for the European Union .
There is a second issue I would like to raise .
We are discussing coherence here .
Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent .
In my view , however , the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too .
Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union ' s budget but the EDF remains outside it .
This , to my mind , is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do , i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union .
First , the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF ; clearly that is misguided .
In our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise .
Why should we add to them ?
It is perfectly astounding that the Union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the Member States in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank .
And let me say in passing , it is even more astonishing that the Council allowed it to .
As a result , we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed .
The part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the Union ends up paying producers to stop producing sherry , port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law .
Imagine the potential cost of such a precedent .
Finally , a word on the general thinking behind the Corrie report .
Nowadays , let us face it , the Joint Assembly is seen as an obstacle to free international trade by the dogmatisers in Geneva and Washington .
It was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened .
The Corrie report missed this chance and we must , regrettably , punish it for losing so much .
.
( PT ) Mr President , by way of both a conclusion and a summary , I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate .
First of all , many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality , and increases poverty .
This suggests that something must be done , failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or worsen .
Secondly , it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context , taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality .
I believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the European Union ' s role in international development policies is significant .
I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council , for the Commission or for Parliament alone .
For this reason it may be necessary , as I have stressed , to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies .
. I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate .
I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion .
We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence .
This discussion is not new .
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it , as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence .
I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything .
I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist , and we certainly do have them .
I would , however , warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system .
This exists , but it is only a small part of what we are discussing .
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on , and this is the problem .
Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low .
This is true in our part of the world , but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective .
They farm , not just for a living , but in order to live , and this makes a difference .
Subsistence farming is not based on price calculations , it is based on the hope of rain in the next season .
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far .
From that perspective , what I am saying here is of deep relevance .
Other issues have been mentioned : cattle-farming in Namibia , tomatoes and milk powder in the Caribbean .
We should not be too masochistic .
There is a limit to how useful that is .
All these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of .
The intervention prices have been regulated , and the problems we had with beef in Western Africa and in Namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support .
These are real problems , but they have all been dealt with .
As regards the issue of cacao , chocolate : I repeat that the 5 % has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries .
What we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in Burkina Faso as coconuts for farmers in Ghana .
This is not a clear case of incoherence , it is more a case of a competition between suppliers .
What was mentioned concerning sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated .
In any case , this is a matter which we are currently dealing with .
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa .
We certainly have done our share to solve that problem , and I sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement .
Finally , I thank you again for this debate .
We have to reconcile those different approaches .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission
The next item is the statement by the Council on EU priorities for the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission on 20 March 2000 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the European Union played an active role in the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held in Geneva in March and April 1999 .
The Union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission to be held in Geneva in March and April .
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March .
In particular , there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty .
As you know , at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year , the United States decided , at a very late stage , to table a draft resolution on China .
This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion .
The European Union voted against that motion .
It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote .
The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution .
This initiative is being discussed within the Union , but with no hope of a decision in the near future .
In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission , we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close .
It is therefore important this year , too , that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution .
In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva .
The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern .
On the other hand , they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity .
On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue , and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas .
Lastly , during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself .
That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues .
For example , discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament ' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases .
It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult .
That does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference .
However , let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues : the death penalty , Cuba and China .
I am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal reflections to creep into my remarks .
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission .
This has always been a subject about which I personally have felt extremely strongly , I have always voted against the death penalty .
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others , one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty .
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly .
The New York stage is different from Geneva .
Last year ' s debate in New York on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues .
It certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty .
The debate in Geneva , however , is more focused on human rights issues .
We may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there .
Secondly , Cuba .
I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously .
We are extremely concerned about moves by the Cuban Government over the last year that have further curtailed public freedom , moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty .
We are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions .
We are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of NGOs and the work of our human rights working group based in the EU embassies in Havana .
We have regularly put our criticisms to the Cuban authorities , and this Parliament has done the same .
But I do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate Cuba .
We want a fair and open society in Cuba , a Cuba which respects the principles of the market , the sanctity of contract and the rule of law .
We want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .
My views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which I wish to deal , namely China .
Quite simply , I want us to be engaged with China .
It would be self-indulgent and self-defeating , as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity , to want anything else .
I also want to see a China transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy activists or religious believers .
So what should we do ?
Naturally we should trade enthusiastically with China and hope that we can welcome China into the World Trade Organisation on sensible terms .
It is a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which does not include China - or Russia , for that matter .
So what should be our attitude towards a Geneva resolution this year ?
As the presidency has noted , the Union as a whole is considering its position .
But I strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the Member States ought to take proper account .
That is a point that deserves serious consideration .
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet .
We have made our views very clear to them .
While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties , there is a dark side to the picture as well .
Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China .
Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres .
That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level .
Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process , but I wish I could point to more real gains .
The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test .
It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not .
What , finally , do we want to see as the first steps ?
Well , for example , we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them .
I wish we were closer to that .
Where does all that leave us this year ?
I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds .
I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions .
But if that is true , then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward .
If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue , then we need to be able to convince you , the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere .
That , in my judgement , is the challenge for the next few weeks .
I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world , and particularly in China .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote .
Welcome
I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament .
( Loud applause )
VOTE
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 , 5 , 6 , 12 , 14 , 18 and 16 .
( The President declared the common position approved as amended )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Before the final vote :
.
. I regret to say that I believe that the thought-out position I advanced yesterday is the correct position .
The comprehensive approach that the Commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under Article 152 where Parliament will have a codecision function .
That is the appropriate way of dealing with this .
Mr President , in accordance with Article 69 ( 2 ) , I call for referral back to committee .
The reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure , as proposed by the Commission .
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time , but the Commission will not adopt this .
( Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee )
Before the vote :
( Applause from the left . Heckling from the right )
.
( DE ) Mr Cohn-Bendit , I do not think that the European Parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country ' s domestic politics , in the way that you are doing .
I can speak for my party , which championed Austria ' s membership of the European Union in the early days .
As a political force , we serve to guarantee that Austria will continue to embrace European values .
I refuse to allow myself to be ostracised for internal and party political reasons !
This does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda .
I utterly reject this !
( Loud , sustained applause from the centre and from the right , protests from the left )
Welcome
This is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery , a delegation of four members of the Moroccan parliament , led by Mr Brahim Rachidi , Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Representatives .
We are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 March 2000 of the Association Agreement between Morocco and the European Union .
On this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments .
It is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries will be visiting Morocco on 20 to 22 March .
I hope the delegation has an excellent visit to Strasbourg .
( Loud applause )

VOTE ( continuation )
We shall now continue with the vote on the Stenzel report on the EQUAL initiative ( A5-0034 / 2000 ) .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Recommendation for second reading :
Before the vote :
. ( FR ) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have , for the most part , been retained in the common position adopted by the Council .
In my opinion , the most important amendments concern the following :
Improving the efficiency , transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE , procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public , and procedures for cooperation between recipients ;
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities , and thus job creation .
I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe .
The other candidate countries ( e.g. Cyprus , Turkey , Malta ) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries .
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies , of course , in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme ( 2000-2004 ) .
The Commission proposal , ratified by the Council , is for EUR 613 million , whilst the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million .
I support Mrs Lienemann ' s firm stance .
The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created , even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement .
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions !
Böge report ( A5-0023 / 2000 )
. ( FR ) As an MEP and , more importantly , as a consumer , I welcome the European Commission ' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union .
What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie .
What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis .
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie .
A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic .
It is a pledge to European citizens , who have voiced their concern , as regards European food policy , on many occasions .
The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard .
As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution , traceability , responsibility and transparency , the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety .
This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence .
It is up to us , as responsible Europeans , to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive .
Cederschiöld report ( A5-0008 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament .
. ( DA ) We oppose , on principle , the European Community ' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States .
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community .
At the same time , we appreciate the fact that the WIPO treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of distributors and practising artists .
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation .
In institutional terms , there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties .
In addition , there is a clear tendency , in matters of international jurisdiction , more and more often to obtain a pure EU jurisdiction .
When it is , then , still not clear to what extent the EP can participate in the decision-making processes , the question of legitimacy arises .
Moreover , the concept of ' author ' is not defined in the Treaties .
One of the trickiest aspects is the public interest : will ratifying and applying WIPO lead to the privatisation of culture ?
And , finally , the matter of the relationship between TRIPs and WIPO must be clarified . Regarding this , too , there has been only silence by way of a response from the Commission .
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation , then we must at least abstain from voting .
Graefe zu Baringdorf ( A5-0015 / 2000 )
.
( PT ) Food safety issues are in the spotlight following the BSE and dioxin scandals .
GMOs are still the subject of great uncertainty , both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health .
The precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty .
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just " packaged " for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector .
The profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises .
Furthermore , he considers that " genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document , official or otherwise , which is affixed to or accompanies the additive " .
This will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer ' s freedom of choice .
In view of the Montreal Protocol on Genetically Modified Organisms ( GMOs ) , I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report , and I have therefore voted in favour of it .
Stenzel report ( A5-0034 / 2000 )
Mr President , I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote , on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report .
We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group .
The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been .
This is why we are abstaining .
We want to ensure that the EQUAL report , which is very important for refugees , the elderly , the handicapped and women , simply goes ahead .
It is regrettable that , due to the procedure , the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session .
I am convinced that the rapporteur ' s nationality has played a certain role , which should not be of relevance in this Parliament .
This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament .
These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report .
We want EQUAL to go ahead .
We assent to the main thrust of it , but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage .
The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice .
. ( DA ) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes ( CIP ) .
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report .
Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague , all too pie in the sky .
The lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on .
EQUAL stands for " equality " .
It must be seen to deliver .
I welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market .
I also favour the desire to move away from an out-dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment .
There must be flexibility .
I deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative .
In the last programming period 9 % of Structural Funds were available for Community initiatives .
The figure is now 5.35 % .
This means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated .
This often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities .
The positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process .
I also stressed the need for prevention .
The involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted .
There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority .
There must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets .
While there are some aspects of the report which I believe would be better dealt with in a different way , overall I believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported .
.
Unfortunately , this involves a significant reduction in appropriations .
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations .
The Commission did not do that .
We hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned .
Lieneman report ( A5-0027 / 2000 )
Mr President , some of us in Parliament will remember the successful film , " Cocoon " , in which some elderly people drank a special kind of water that made them young again .
In my view , it is , therefore , immensely important to exercise extreme vigilance over the water we all drink and , consequently , to study and approve the provisions referred to here .
Apart from Amendment No 76 , which was an error , since I intended to vote in favour , the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following fictional situation :
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe : " Nevertheless , this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions " .
( End of fiction ) .
We cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts , such as the Mediterranean countries , and countries with northern levels of rainfall .
Furthermore , it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water , between different river basins , practically impossible in the future .
Once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union .
. ( FR ) Drinking , eating , washing , farming - water irrigates each act of our daily life and we treat it , wrongly , as an unfailing and inexhaustible resource .
A simple gesture such as turning on a tap seems to bring water straight from the source .
But the source is threatening to run dry .
Scientific studies are now no more than a formality : water will be the main resource at stake in years to come , starting tomorrow .
But tomorrow will be too late .
We have to lay down the rules of play today , before we all lose .
In adopting the water directive on Wednesday 15 February , the European Parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water , coastal wasters , inland waters and groundwater .
We have thrown water a life-belt .
. ( FR ) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy .
Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework .
The procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy .
The proposal for a directive was amended twice , first in 1997 and then in 1998 .
A technical working party made up of Council and Parliament representatives met in January 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions .
However , the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments , most of which I support .
The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020 , the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020 .
All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years , not 16 .
I must say that I support these reduced deadlines , especially as provision is made for derogations .
As far as costs are concerned , I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources .
. I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote .
We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water .
There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur .
However , the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which , under the rules of subsidiarity , should be left to the Member States for decision .
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue .
In Ireland all the major users of water , commercial , industrial and agricultural , already pay for their use of water .
This is a decision of national and local government , and this is where all future decisions should be retained .
These are the main reasons for my vote .
I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy .
However , I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used .
Water , in this context , is a commercial commodity .
It is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life .
We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved .
But it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated , and that action on this aspect will affect all the others .
The " physico-chemical and ecological quality of water " was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals , and the adverse effects of other aspects was , at best , touched upon marginally .
. ( FR ) We are disappointed by the Council ' s common position on this proposal for a framework directive .
It is minimalist on a number of points , especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of , and conditions for , implementing the derogations .
However , the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the European Union wishes to pursue with this text .
The objective is of course to create , first and foremost , a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified .
However the Union should be seeking , beyond that , to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater .
Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake , as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species .
From this point of view , the common position is weak .
I should like to see our Parliament defend a more ambitious position than the Council ' s position , but I should also like that position to be equally credible .
The " zero input " and " zero pollution " requirement , including for substances naturally present in water , is not realistic .
On the contrary , I object to this systematically applied strategy .
It damages Parliament .
Our messages to our citizens and to the Council are muddled and lack credibility .
Overly strict , unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are unattainable .
Is that the message we want to send out ?
There is one other specific point which is dear to me : Member States should be able , if they so wish , to set up trans-national water transfers .
. ( ES ) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war .
We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective , above all , given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment .
It is clear that this model ' s logic of private profit has been harmful , and therefore the ' polluter pays ' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences .
However , apart from these principles , there is the consideration that water , as a common resource , cannot be subjected to the rules of the market .
In fact , water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market .
This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water .
. On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party , I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report , we have certain reservations .
The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable , but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance .
We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date .
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater .
We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard .
The foregoing is the reason for our vote .
. ( FR ) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed .
The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area .
It has clear , ambitious objectives .
We share them .
It sets environmental parameters close to zero .
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet .
We need a timetable , by all means , but a more gradual timetable .
The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation , i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years , would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances .
Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries , thereby complicating enlargement .
I should like , naturally , to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached , i.e. agriculture , the main water-consuming sector .
Agriculture must accept its share of ' polluter pays ' charges , and has in fact already started to do so , but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints , especially in arid regions .
As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances , I am of course in favour of controls , but the question arises of the legal basis , which comes under the Euratom Treaty .
Andersson report ( A5-0033 / 2000 )
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report .
Now , the concept of " uniform harmonisation " is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question .
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation " .
The situation , however , is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation , and uniform harmonisation into the bargain .
Finally , paragraph 7 emphasises that " the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination " .
And , in this regard , we approach the heart of the matter .
This project , with its social harmonisation , does not constitute social policy .
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project .
I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions .
The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now .
The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection .
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but , rather , better use of available resources .
No-one would benefit from this situation .
( SV ) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals , which we support , but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report .
In particular , we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the Commission ' s becoming involved in telling the Member States what to do ( see , for example , paragraph 7 ) .
. ( FR ) The current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment , poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending .
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation .
Of course we need to modernise these systems .
In France , in particular , we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions .
We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices , chaos and waste .
More importantly , we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic , monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs .
Social protection should be an expression , first and foremost , of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost , exclusively in fact , under the jurisdiction of the nation state .
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences .
Otherwise it is merely the financial processing , at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens , of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration .
. ( SV ) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson ' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union .
As Swedish Liberals , we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment , trade , movement across borders , human rights and conflict management .
In these areas , Europe ' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect .
That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see .
It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with , which is to say cross-border issues .
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local , regional or national levels .
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers , except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union .
Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for , and the right autonomously to decide upon , its social security systems .
Health care , child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational .
The same applies to labour market policy .
We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security .
For us , it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use .
That does not , however , prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere .
Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda .
We wholeheartedly support , at national level , many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson ' s report .
There are three main aspects that need to be highlighted . The first is that economic policy , employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional .
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them .
Nowadays , it is becoming more commonplace , as well as efficient , to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes .
But , in our view , that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced , either as regards the universality or , we hope , the quality of the basic social protection provided .
The third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the European Union .
Today , a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking , and the current systems are , in the main , run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual Member States .
Therefore , any modernisation process has to take account of economic , employment and social protection differences between the various countries , whether Member States or candidate countries .
It is , after all , a matter of civilisation , progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community .
. ( SV ) The basic values common to the Member States of the European Union are based upon democracy , human freedoms and rights , and a social market economy .
These values must be given expression in the form of solidarity with the weaker groups in our society and in the world around us .
In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , it is the Member States themselves which devise their own social security systems .
Inhabitants of countries in the European Union ought , nonetheless , to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection , irrespective of which country they live in .
The report seeks " effective and ambitious fiscal coordination " , without going on to define more specifically what this means .
As we see it , such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot , therefore , be supported .
We are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report .
The report emphasises the social dimension of European cooperation , which is something to be welcomed .
It is nonetheless important to clarify what role the EU is to play , and not to play , with regard to social security .
Clarification of this kind is missing from the report , which is unfortunate .
We agree with many of the rapporteur ' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the Commission ' s and the Council ' s intentions and plans concerning social protection .
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security , and for flexibilising social protection itself .
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Next session of UN Human Rights Commission ( continuation )
The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights ( 20 March 2000 ) , including the situation in China .
Mr President , I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council .
This is a Council declaration , and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate .
Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission , I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see .
I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights .
In my opinion , this resolution contains a series of essential points , but I would like to stress one in particular , that is , the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations .
In order to make our actions effective , we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present .
Soon , in May , the European Commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the Union ' s external relations .
I believe that this should be applied to all areas , in particular also the budgetary area .
Lastly , I must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area , as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non-governmental organisations who act on the ground .
The Union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work .
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished .
The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on , particularly at the level of prevention .
In that sense , we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law .
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed .
Nowadays , there are many , perhaps too many , treaties on human rights . If those treaties remain mere expressions , they are no more than useless depositories of people 's thoughts .
In my view , we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally .
In particular , we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded .
Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process .
All those aspects should be part of a rationale , a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights .
That is what we hope for and is the cordial message that we are sending our governments , even if it goes against their interests .
Mr President , one of the saving features of this Parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy : the flag flies high , as Mrs Malmström put it .
At the same time , however , we shut our eyes to the Union ' s own problems : to the violence , inequality , and fourth world reality , which is part of everyday life in the EU .
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva .
The rhetoric that we use , however , often smacks of smugness , verging on the sort of narcissism we associate with human rights attitudes in North America .
Let us , in particular , focus attention on the re-admission clauses , which present a threat to the Geneva Convention and which should be blocked .
I fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction , towards European exclusiveness and apartheid .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , in my view , the question which needs to be raised in Geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty .
We have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in Geneva .
We failed at the General Assembly last year on a fallacious pretext , I refer to article 2.7 , which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts .
The question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year ' s General Assembly , certainly not at the Geneva session .
As Mr Patten said , and I would like to thank him for the positions which he defended , the crucial point is China .
There is regression in every sector of Chinese civil society .
It is a fact : China is the major threat , the major threat to us , the threat which we must confront , the threat to peace .
It is the antithesis of democracy and you know as well as I that the Chinese , the Chinese leadership , is Communist first and Chinese second .
China likes doublespeak .
Until we have a firm position , we will achieve nothing with the Chinese authorities .
I think we need to seize the opportunity .
We need to associate ourselves with the American initiative .
We need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted .
We need to work .
Mr President , I would like to try to put a different perspective to this .
As you know , on Monday an unmanned spacecraft went into orbit around a peanut-shaped asteroid called Eros which is not very far from earth .
Photographs show us that there is no life on the asteroid , but much further out in our galaxy , the Milky Way , there are about 300 billion stars , many with planets .
Beyond the Milky Way there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets .
It is probable , therefore , that there is a lot of life out there , and much of it much more advanced than we are .
What do they see ?
They see a beautiful planet , teeming with life , but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up .
They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading .
Of the living creatures , they can see many animals that are treated cruelly , rare ones becoming extinct for ever .
How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us ?
Well , they see the planet 's resources being unevenly spread .
What do they see about the relationships between human beings ?
They see us killing each other .
They see us restricting each other 's liberties .
They see a never-ending series of local wars .
They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers , or treated as prostitutes or slaves .
They see unequal treatment of men and women , of people of different ages , of minorities , of people of different coloured skins , of races , of beliefs , of immigrants , even neighbours .
We all know the picture .
The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this .
We should salute it - and I think we do .
Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law .
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights , which is being discussed at the moment , to become enforceable in law .
I say : shame on them !
Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world . That is the goal which we have to work towards .
Much , as Commissioner Patten said , remains to be done .
Mr President , human rights are universal , indivisible , interrelated and interwoven .
This well-known phrase , which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993 , is known off by heart by many .
That is positive .
But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself ?
Does it reflect this vision of coherence ?
In fact , does the European Union have a human rights policy ?
No , Mr President , I am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself .
A new government has come into power in Austria , comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis-à-vis minorities .
There is , therefore a need for a fully-fledged human rights policy for and by the European Union , a policy which promotes and enforces human rights within the EU itself .
Such policy should comprise various components .
Firstly : a regulatory framework is needed , which spells out very clearly the rights which the EU intends to secure for its citizens .
This is a political question which , in the short term , requires an answer from the IGC and this Parliament .
Thirdly : it will need to be made clear for each of the EU institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the European Union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails .
The Commission and the Council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be .
This Parliament is excluded from this , for our Rules of Procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs carries this responsibility .
Mr President , this Parliament is fragmented and divided .
I think that this will benefit our credibility in the UN Human Rights Committee .
I do not know if he is still present and can hear me .
In a word , I shall believe your talk about human rights in Europe , fellow Members , when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves .
I shall believe your talk about human rights in China when you name the real cause of the problem , i.e. Communism .
Mr President , the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century .
The holocaust , fifty years ago , led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms .
Since the end of the cold war , compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation .
Leaders violating these principles now face international criticism , sanctions and are even brought to trial , such as ex-dictators like Mr Pinochet have experienced .
These developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very disquieting .
Especially in situations of war , civilians are given less consideration all the time .
It seems contradictory .
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed .
Never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries .
Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago .
Women are systematically raped .
Children are conscripted by force and deployed in battle .
Excesses are no longer the exception , they have unfortunately become the rule .
This applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide .
Too late , too selective and too fragmented : this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community .
Fifty years later , we are still unable to prevent genocide .
We should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency .
Control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this .
The human rights policy is also too selective .
The months of NATO bombardments of Kosovo and the mediation attempts in the Middle East are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in Africa .
I cannot shake off the impression that , when it comes to human rights , despite all the rhetoric , Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency .
This is something which I very much regret .
The impression that Africans get , namely that they are inferior world citizens , is not unfounded .
I would like to warn against a blurring of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in Africa , where violations are viewed as a necessary evil .
But above all , the human rights policy is too fragmented .
We are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or Europe .
Take Sudan .
The international community is sending conflicting messages to this country .
Britain has re-opened its embassy in Khartoum .
Canada has invited the Sudanese for peace talks .
Europe puts the rebels in the South under pressure to negotiate and at the same time , Americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level .
There is a need for more coordination , more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided .
Only then can we follow in the footsteps of the founders of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
Mr President , I would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home .
But unfortunately , as we speak today in the safety of this Chamber , human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world .
Sometimes the more we speak , the less we hear - motions : words ; conventions : words ; treaties : words - if we are not careful , words themselves become a substitute for real action .
Words framed in inclusive and liberating documents become treaties and conventions which are often paraded as a testimony to a country 's respect for and adherence to human rights .
Yet words spoken , written or signed are not in themselves enough .
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities , groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming .
The defamation of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination .
Even within the EU citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions .
Every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to denigrate ethnic minorities .
Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created .
And so long as people do not have equality before the law , this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded .
In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities .
We must not waiver in that commitment .
But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies .
Yes , conventions have been signed , but action is needed .
I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices , eternal vigilance , not just outside our borders but within .
That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken .
Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us .
What happens in another part of the world affects us .
Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria .
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked .
Human rights do not exist in isolation , they are connected to our development policies , our economic policies , our home affairs policies , indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions .
I would repeat what Mr Patten said : we must engage , we must inform , educate and thereby effect real and lasting change .
Mr President , " Europe stands for ideals , values and principles .
We must emphasise Europe ' s spiritual history . Together , we must re-establish the values which unite Europe .
Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe .
We must live with our consciences . "
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic , Vaclav Havel .
We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe .
I wish to discuss two matters .
First of all , civil society .
Vaclav Havel stated that , in Eastern Europe , the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society : national movements , churches and the independent trade unions .
The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches . It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet .
We must never forget to defend civil society .
I also want to mention the death penalty .
Like my own country , Sweden , the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal , unique and inviolable value of every human .
On the basis of this principle , human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves .
Try telling that to the governments of the United States , Russia and China .
Mr President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo , Mexico , Saudi Arabia , Sierra Leone and China .
In relation to China , we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked .
However , it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one , and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve .
However , if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva , then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources .
The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat .
Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights , strategic planning , the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations .
To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks .
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds .
Mr President , this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission ' s and Council ' s efforts in this respect .
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister , and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda .
Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this , with all due sympathy to Cuba .
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy .
I would , during my two minutes , like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart .
The first country is Indonesia .
We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President .
We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction .
But I can report that in the Moluccas , an area just north of Timor , the violence is still not under control .
This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years .
Tens of thousands of people are on the run .
The situation is badly managed .
I know that tomorrow , or the day after tomorrow , an important programme will be shown on Dutch television , in which an appeal will be made for observers .
My urgent request , which has been echoed many times in resolutions , is the following : could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas ?
Surely thousands of people killed , thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough .
My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma .
Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma .
I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion .
For ten years now , the elected President of that country has been under house arrest .
And for ten years now , its parliament has been out of action .
Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma .
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention .
In my opinion , Burma should be put back on the agenda , too , certainly in the wake of Indonesia ' s U-turn .
Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch , even by Europe .
My request is , in fact , to put this country back on the top of the agenda .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union ' s status in the world .
One of the EU ' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights , as exercised both within the Union and by our partners .
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia , a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account .
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position .
Justice needs to be done in Indonesia .
Justice needs to be done in East Timor .
President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with .
The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor , on the initiative of the PPE Group , is a timely one .
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there , some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House ; they cannot go unpunished .
This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency .
.
Indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen Member States to meet in Lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered .
For all these reasons I thought it essential to reply directly to Mr Van Hecke ' s question on this issue .
. Mr President , this has been a very useful debate .
One or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully .
For example , Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there .
What I would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate .
One of the very first speakers , Mr Wuori , spoke of the remarks made earlier today by Mr Havel .
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch , who is no longer able to be with us , was able to hear that speech as well .
I also hope that , if there is any life in outer space , as has been speculated by Mr Newton Dunn , it was tuned in to Mr Havel ' s speech as well .
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes ?
One or two honourable Members , Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan , spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality .
Mr Cashman said , which is right in a sense , that words are no substitute for real action .
Of course , words can make a bit of a difference , a point that was made by Mrs Malmström .
I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities .
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China .
I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations , many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today .
There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca , who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate .
There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy .
It is immensely important , and if I had not thought that already , having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion .
It has been a useful debate .
I hope we can have further debates like this .
I have received 7 motions for resolution , pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present statement .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
Cyprus and Malta
The next item is the joint debate on :
the Council statement on the position of the European Union on developments concerning Cyprus ;
Mr Seixas da Costa has the floor on behalf of the Council .
At the beginning of December 1999 , the first round of negotiations were held in New York , after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the Cypriot communities in the north and south of the island .
These negotiations took the form of indirect discussions mediated by the UN special representative , Álvaro de Soto .
A further round was held in January this year , starting on 31 January , and a third round is scheduled to start on 23 May in New York .
There is a possibility , which has not yet been absolutely confirmed , that continuous and direct discussions may take place , with work continuing until September this year .
These discussions essentially cover four areas : security , the structure of government , territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation , as a result of the situation following the partition of the island .
This is the position of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis .
Furthermore , the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has decided , following the example of previous presidencies , to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue .
This representative has already contacted all these parties and has , in close cooperation with the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations , been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds .
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement , and this relates to Turkey ' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession .
This window of opportunity involves combining various factors , one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between Turkey and the European Union .
This is key as regards the future of this issue .
It may also give the European Union access to data enabling it to justify accession , as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions .
Furthermore , this means that we in the Council - and I think that Parliament will join us in this - should encourage the Commission ' s involvement in this undertaking .
It is essential for us to send the Commission a message of confidence about its role in this area .
As I said at the beginning , the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council last December have had a visible impact on the way the positions of the various parties to this process have developed .
The Nicosia Government has expressed its satisfaction with the Helsinki conclusions , which open up the way to accession to the European Union without solving the partition of the island beforehand .
Nevertheless , I have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition , which will evidently imply some concessions .
This is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island .
We believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome .
As far as we , the Council presidency , are concerned , we will continue to follow these developments very closely , and we will certainly cooperate with the Secretary-General and his personal representative on this matter .
In particular , we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue .
Mr President , we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations .
For example , I would not refer to the government of Nicosia .
It is the Cypriot Government , Mr President-in-Office , not the government of Nicosia .
On the other hand , the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us .
Mr President , we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta .
This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and , once it is implemented , will replace the financial protocols which have now expired .
Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis .
It was pointed out , during the discussion of Mr Brok ' s excellent report in committee , that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that .
The declarations made on the Cyprus question by the Council and the Commission were therefore most opportune and I should like to thank the President of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen .
In other words , accession should not be held hostage to a political solution .
The two processes are separate processes .
This unequivocal position on the part of the European Parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy .
The presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever .
On the contrary , it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when Cyprus joins the European Union and prepares for a turning point in its history .
However , I also think that we in the EU should be making a constructive contribution .
I also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements , which we must solve .
There is , of course , the question of pre-accession aid , and this belongs in category seven .
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven , where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out .
This is the crux of the matter .
The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed , and in the correct category , so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned .
It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full .
But we are also convinced that , despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations , it is not enough .
The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future .
In particular , we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island .
I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which , in my view , need clarifying .
I think that we need , first and foremost , to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind , i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations .
Cyprus should be one sovereign state , with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised .
The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force .
Secondly , the European Union stands to gain , in my view , by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council .
The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus ' s accession to the Union , as Mr Poos has reminded us .
If it were , Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union , which is , of course , unacceptable .
Thirdly , we must not , in turn , allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union .
Mr President , there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important .
The big question , however , is from what budget heading should this aid be financed ?
The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4 .
This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last .
The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7 .
The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7 .
This is an extremely risky strategy .
In fact , the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament .
Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings .
Moreover , what is the real significance of financial ceilings if they are increased for every new action ?
I would therefore advocate that the EUR 15 million in category 4 be dropped , in line with the Commission ' s proposal .
A multiannual budget of the Commission later on in the year , may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years .
Mr President , all over the world work is being done to resolve long-standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal enmities and hatreds .
I hope that the decisions taken at Helsinki lead to progress on the Cyprus issue . I hope this signals a new era of hope for Cyprus .
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue .
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government .
I hope that has an encouraging effect on the Cyprus talks .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Verheugen , the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission .
Rather , the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me .
This applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect .
In my view , it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the Union to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining .
As Vaclav Havel rightly said today , the European Union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual .
As far as the citizens are concerned , it is what a regulation can do for them that matters .
We will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned .
It is makeshift and contains heteronomous paragraphs , which is no way to set a shining example .
The quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria : is it decentralised , is it transparent , is it accessible to the citizens and does it work ?
Nonetheless , as far as the divided island of Cyprus is concerned , overall , this pre-accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge .
In my view , it is the task of the European Union to employ all instruments , including this one , so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means .
I must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the European Parliament that is so important to me in this respect .
Both the Commission and the Council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well .
I am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect .
I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union .
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot , the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country .
The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government , which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº .
Even in this Chamber , the Council ' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories .
It is not by chance that , immediately after Helsinki , the Turkish Prime Minister , Bulent Ecevit , stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974 .
Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General .
On their course towards accession , the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal , but stand to lose even more .
The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy , especially in agriculture .
It entails the liquidation of the public sector , and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus .
Mr President , I beg your pardon , but the French interpreter made a small error , on the most sensitive word in the debate , during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said .
I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity .
Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying " the confederate solution would be best " .
Obviously , he said " the federal solution would be best " .
It is a most important point and needs to be clarified , Mr President .
Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz .
Mr President , Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe .
The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments .
Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise , their dynamism and their flexibility .
Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry , growing financial services , good agriculture , magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities , all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources .
Thus , when I look at this proposed instrument I do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the fold of Mother Europe .
The situation is more akin to a black hole in space , sucking in masses so powerfully that not even light escapes .
The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone .
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class , and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners .
This means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the Cyprus problem .
Helsinki was an historic event , an historic turning-point and an historic new reference point .
Conditions are ripe .
In any event , the outcome is in your hands .
The outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions , to the extent that we are providing you with options .
They have healthy economies , high-level economic relations , and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union ' s political will .
I hope there has been an interpretation error , and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech .
.
Mr Wurtz , in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue : the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus .
In fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side .
We will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations , which is a delicate and sensitive phase , by exploiting tensions .
No , we should continue to make progress by working discreetly to support the special representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with his remit .
We are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model implying political recognition .
I believe that , over time , the Council of the European Union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue .
Decisions have been taken by the Council with a great sense of responsibility .
We believe that Helsinki was very clear in this respect .
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive .
There is no point in second-guessing or trying to second-guess our intentions .
However , I would be more than pleased to elucidate a few points as requested .
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7 .
Malta , Cyprus and Turkey were not provided for at this stage .
Mrs Schroedter described this as a lack of coherence .
She ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council , who is not exactly a stranger to you , how this presumed lack of coherence has come about .
I have had a little to do with this too .
Hitherto this has been out of the question of course .
By way of clarification : if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget .
If we do this , then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount .
The idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone , is not workable .
Parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got , at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the basement that we can use to print euro notes !
As for the peace process in Cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations , I would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two .
The Commission and the Council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in Cyprus to undertake joint projects .
So far , as you know , this has proved unsuccessful , and I have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary .
Mrs Rothe , I would put it this way : I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind .
I do not have confirmation of this at present , and nor do I expect it , since we have not yet held direct talks .
These will take place at a later date .
There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union .
Therefore , it is my firm belief that , since Helsinki , there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict .
Indeed that was the idea behind it .
After only a few weeks , Mrs Rothe , it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this , but in any case , I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail .
Finally , of course , the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey .
I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue .
I would just make one point : we cannot be 100 % sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus .
It is very far from being that simple , rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts , during talks with both communities , to encourage them to reach an understanding .
That is what we intend to do : the necessary measures and programmes are in place .
I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation , the one that has yet to be decided on here , before we can even get started .
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus .
I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place , because I lack the legal basis for doing so .
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point , then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that .
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management .
.
.
( PT ) Mr President , I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council .
I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate .
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent , regardless of who was involved in that work .
In any case , the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , as I understood it , Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still .
Mr President , I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer .
I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us .
Forgive me Mr Poos .
There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me .
This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA : Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes , but not in the country-specific ones , because the incomes are too high .
Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0009 / 2000 ) .
We will examine questions to the Council .
Question No 1 by ( H-0022 / 00 ) :
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika .
The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field .
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations .
There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject .
There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports .
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals , given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure .
I am pleased that the Council is considering this question .
The President of the Council comes from a country , Portugal , which is directly at risk from just this type of situation .
Of course , the story of the Erika seems comical .
A French-owned ship , under a Maltese flag of convenience , an Indian crew , a sea-worthiness certificate issued by Italy , in Sicily , with the last inspection carried out in Bulgaria , I think .
The ship was sinking and the captain realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port .
This kind of situation should not be allowed .
The damage to your country , Mr President , and to mine , Spain , could be horrendous .
However , we have to work within the existing legislative framework .
That legislative framework is the 1995 directive , which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously .
In this area we have to work with the world as it is , and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation .
In view of the seriousness of such situations , we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field .
The Commission ' s intentions in this area are positive , as it intends to reinforce the application of the 1995 directive .
The Council is minded to give priority to this area , within the Transport Council , and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible .
We also hope that the European Parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal promptness when it comes before this House under the codecision procedure .
Mr President , in Kotka , in Finland , there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals , which is sailing under a flag of convenience .
- ( PT ) Mrs Korhola , as you will understand , I do not at the moment have the information I need to give you a concrete reply .
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive , which does not include any provisions of that kind .
However , the Council will certainly let you have a concrete reply on the options available for acting in the case you have mentioned .
Question No 2 by ( H-0024 / 00 ) :
Mr President , Mrs Karamanou ' s question is an extremely serious one , and I would not wish to conceal that fact .
I think it is well known that the European Union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community .
This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification .
Furthermore , as you know , the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees , which came to EUR 66.3 million in 1999 .
I think that Mrs Karamanou is aware that , because of the need for division of labour between the international donors , the task of restoring health care in Kosovo has been entrusted to the World Health Organisation .
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation , and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I thank you for your answer which supplements what Commissioner Patten said yesterday on the subject .
So , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long-suffering inhabitants of Kosovo , and above all , keep our promises to them ?
Mrs Karamanou , I recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this field have not been enough .
I do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that .
Nevertheless , I would like to say that the European Union is aware that the resources it has devoted to Kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within .
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community .
This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole .
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica .
In cooperation with Europe , the international community rebuilt the hospital there too , but it is located in the northern part of the city , thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars .
This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars .
I understand very well what you are saying and you are right : the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation .
But where will you place the emphasis ?
What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital , including that in Mitrovica ?
Mr Staes , the situation in Mitrovica is well known .
This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo .
I perfectly understand Mr Staes ' s concerns .
I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible , because there are various protagonists involved .
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling , and involves very special tensions , and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed .
Question No 3 by ( H-0027 / 00 ) :
On the basis of this evidence , some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal , NATO is accused of ' serious violations of international humanitarian law ' and ' wilful murder ' .
Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation ?
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed ?
Mr President , Mr Alavanos ' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues .
I am aware that there may be different views about NATO ' s action and the legitimacy of that action .
Everyone is free to hold such views .
In my own country , the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter .
That was how it was .
This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April .
This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted .
All information received during the past six months , either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO ' s actions during the Kosovo conflict , have been recorded by the Prosecutor .
Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor , who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action .
Until that time Prosecutor Del Ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of criminality made against NATO .
If the President-in-Office has noticed , almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to Kosovo .
Despite this , he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the War Crimes Tribunal against NATO after applications by Canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question .
The duties that he exercises today have nothing whatsoever to do with the duties that he exercised during his time as Secretary-General of NATO .
Mr President , I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up .
Mr Milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding NATO the Sakharov prize .
But I have a quite different question for the Council .
How do matters stand in Kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration , the judiciary and , most importantly of all , the police force ?
You mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done .
Rapid action is called for !
First of all , I would like to say that I agree with the priorities you have identified concerning personal responsibility , Mr Posselt .
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo , we have already heard Mr Kouchner , on various occasions , describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure .
As you know , the first steps were taken some months ago .
Statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various Member States who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments .
Some Member States are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces , to which they committed themselves , as quickly as they would like .
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner ' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo , especially as regards judicial structures and police cover .
I would like to make this clear on behalf of the Council , so that there can be no doubt .
So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets .
This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars , and the Kosovo war was not a clean war , nor a model war , but a war based on the art of the possible .
Question No 4 by ( H-0028 / 00 ) :
Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia ?
Mr President , I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer .
Nevertheless , I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when , ultimately , there is in fact a major tripartite relationship .
Our relationship with Armenia , as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year , is of course one element in these foreign relations .
We are , moreover , convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 5 and 6 will be taken together .
Question No 5 by ( H-0031 / 00 ) :
What steps will the Council take in view of the above in order to ensure compliance with UN decisions and , in particular , resolution 1244 and prevent the secession of the province of Kosovo from Serbia ?
Question No 6 by ( H-0122 / 00 ) :
During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups , also with impunity .
Mr President , I am sorry , but , listening to the Council ' s representative , one really has to wonder how far hypocrisy , tolerance and complicity can go .
It is a fact that , as they say in my country , in the home of a hanged man one does not mention ropes .
Yugoslavia used to be a peaceful country , a paragon of stability and peace .
It was NATO ' s interventions and initially those of Germany which led to all that has happened .
So it is not the Belgrade Government that is responsible , but NATO itself , the imperialists and their interventions .
What do we have today ?
We have a flagrant violation of Security Council Resolution 1244 and this proves that it was a trap .
We have 350 000 Serbians , Gypsies and other nationalities , besides Albanian Kosovars , who have been expelled .
Nine-hundred were murdered , 800 abducted , and 8 months later we have a continuing and flagrant violation of the Security Council ' s resolution .
In conclusion , since the Minister mentioned Mr Kouchner , I would like to say that , with his 25 decrees , Kouchner is violating both the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and the Security Council ' s resolution .
He has created a separate currency , a judicial body ...
( The President interrupted the speaker )
Let us see things as they are , Mr President !
I thank the Minister for his response , but I would also like to point out that , statistically , there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing .
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation , and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action .
We are therefore all to blame .
I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context .
Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia ?
Mr President , I am no friend of Milosevic or his government .
I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO , but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree .
In any event , I , on behalf of the Council , do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , since I know the history of the Balkans , I should like to remind you that , for many decades , the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace .
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia , in which the European Union played a decisive part .
Yugoslavia ' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union .
So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA , under the very nose of KFOR , whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent .
Every day , new crimes come to light against non-Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo , and there are hundreds of violations of the UN ' s Resolution 1244 .
The division of Yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept , regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way .
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution .
Quite the contrary , it would be a solution leading to calamity .
Mr President , I was a little disappointed with the answer given by the President-in-Office to my colleague .
It is very important , if we stress that Europe is to be a Europe of values , that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends .
If civilian targets were targeted and destroyed , killing civilians is illegal by anyone 's standards .
It should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the Milosevic regime .
That , however , is not my question .
My question is about political prisoners held in Serbia now .
There are , I believe , around 5 000 Kosovar political prisoners held in Serbia at the moment .
My question to the President-in-Office is twofold .
Firstly , is the Council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners ?
Secondly , what does it propose to do about them ?
Mr MacCormick , first of all , I would like to answer your comments .
I did not defend attacks on civilians .
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area .
As I said , we are not making value judgements about specific actions .
We are making an overall value judgement about NATO ' s action , and this overall value judgement is positive . We agree with the general view of NATO ' s action .
In spite of everything , all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society , and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation .
This is precisely why the European Union is maintaining all its sanctions until Yugoslavia ' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend .
Question No 7 by ( H-0035 / 00 ) :
Subject : Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up .
It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century .
What are the Council 's views on the substance of the Charter ? What type of rights will the Charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ?
Which citizens will it cover ( those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement ? Will it cover immigrants etc . ? ) ?
Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda ?
What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?
What are the Council 's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union ?
I thank the President-in-Office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work .
As I said , Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group , and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter .
This matter should form part of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Furthermore , we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue .
I do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not .
I would remind Members that , according to the guidelines for these sittings , questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer .
You know that there is a Parliamentary delegation chaired by Mr Méndez de Vigo and a Committee on Constitutional Affairs where these issues can be debated at great length .
I therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief .
Otherwise , we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything , but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers .
Mr Rübig has the floor .
Mr President , fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State , because a democratically elected government was formed there .
Both parties were once part of the government .
So far there have been no infringements of the law .
Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights ?
Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council , in respect of the formation of national governments , be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up ?
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands , or will the Council feel free to amend that document ?
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter ?
- ( PT ) The answer is neither yes nor no .
I do not know , Mr Martin . It will depend on the decision taken by the Council .
Question No 8 by ( H-0042 / 00 ) :
These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects .
Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process ?
The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is ' minded to grant ' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey .
The World Bank has decided not to fund the project , which will displace 20 000 Kurds , potentially limit the fresh water supply to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological damage .
What is the Council 's view of the involvement of European governments and companies in this project ?
I wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by EU companies in the EU applicant countries .
I ask this because of the issue of coherence , the subject of this morning ' s discussion .
Can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring ?
- ( PT ) Mrs Lucas , I was not present at the debate you are referring to .
I would like to say that the Council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing , at a later date .
Question No 9 by ( H-0044 / 00 ) :
Many local and European associations have strongly criticised the project .
Similar cases occur in other regions of the Union , where EU development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures .
Is not the Council of the opinion that the Court of Auditors should be given more resources in order to investigate or review similar development measures where environmental conflicts arise ?
What kind of measures does the Council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the European institutions in similar cases ?
This is indeed also stipulated in Article 248 .
The Court of Auditors , therefore , already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role .
In some cases , it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased , but there are budgetary restraints of which I am sure you are aware .
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament .
The Council therefore , has no means of changing the role conferred on the Court of Auditors by the Treaty .
If extra resources were given to the Court of Auditors it would be money well spent , because it would ensure that EU funding was not going to something that conflicted with environmental concerns .
For years the Council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes .
I would ask you , now that you are President of the Council , will you push forward with this extremely important proposal .
Secondly , as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ?
I would like to know what you could do about this as President-in-Office of the Council at the moment because it is the Council that has been blocking this for a long time .
It is extremely important .
If the Court of Auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development , it would be very important because the Court of Auditors could do an extremely good job .
Their reports are extremely detailed and very important .
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future .
- ( PT ) Mrs McKenna , a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the Commission .
It is therefore the Commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions .
The Commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions .
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted .
Question No 10 by ( H-0053 / 00 ) :
Subject : Statute for Members of the European Parliament The Council and Parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament .
One of the matters to be settled is whether Members are to receive equal pay , and where they are to pay tax .
According to media reports the Portuguese Presidency considers that all Members should pay the same tax , to the EU .
This is in conflict with the view taken by some Member States who wish to have the right to tax their Members in their home countries .
Will the Portuguese Presidency clarify its position on this matter ?
The Portuguese Presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities , as furthermore , did the President of the European Parliament , when she stated this at the Helsinki European Council .
We are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter .
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise , and we have already begun work on this matter .
The Presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of Members of this Parliament and with the group to which Parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the Council .
I myself had an opportunity to meet this group , for the first time , in parallel with the January part-session , and I am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions .
This has , from the outset , been the position of the Portuguese Presidency .
Nevertheless , our role as mediator means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the Council and I am sure you are aware , Mr Sjöstedt , that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations .
As this is the case , whatever solution is found , I think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all Member States , regardless of their national positions on the matter .
Mr President , I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer .
I want to ask two follow-up questions connected with the taxation of ourselves as parliamentarians .
My basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives , in which one ' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services .
I intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do .
Is there any argument for our being given a special privilege just because we are parliamentarians ?
That is my first question .
- ( PT ) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve , I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately .
We are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations . This sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the Presidency of the Council of the European Union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations .
This has an impact of course , because it is read by other members of the Council .
At this stage in the discussion , please forgive me if I cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me .
I would ask that we be judged on our results , when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future .
I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem .
Mr President , I want to thank you for your answer .
I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked .
We both come from Sweden .
In our country , we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local . We have extensive services , too .
We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and , not least , in European politicians here in Parliament .
How do you think a system like that would affect people ' s confidence in ourselves as politicians ?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question .
However , if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy , go ahead !
. Mr President , I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy .
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society .
I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter .
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed , Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Address by Mr Vaclav Havel , President of the Czech Republic
Mr President in office , ladies and gentlemen , I have great honour in extending a warm welcome , on behalf of the House , to the President of the Czech Republic , Mr Vaclav Havel .
I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel , who is sitting in the gallery .
You are most welcome .
( Applause )
This is not your first visit to our Parliament , Mr President .
In fact , shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified , you spoke in favour of strengthening European values , creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe .
In other words , for many citizens , and not just in your country , you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment .
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties .
An association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the European Parliament and the Czech Parliament .
Your country filed an official application to join the Union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998 .
The process of European integration and enlargement has speeded up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain .
The end of this artificial separation of Europe marked the start of a new era .
We now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of Europe .
Mr President , you are a symbol of these changes .
You founded and signed Charter 77 , the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people .
A Communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity .
But you never lost hope and history proved you right .
Ten years ago , the " velvet revolution " proclaimed Havel na HRAD .
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and , later , the Czech Republic , as its president .
Reconciliation with your neighbours was , and still is , a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance .
You are a first class European .
Today , the Czech Republic is preparing to join our Union .
The European Union , for its part , will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement .
It has already taken a big step forward with Agenda 2000 .
The next step , i.e. institutional reform , will be taken following the inauguration of the new Intergovernmental Conference , in which the European Parliament will be fully involved .
Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor .
( Applause )
Mr President , allow me , on behalf of the European Parliament , to extend our warmest thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation .
Thank you . You are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a European identity .
And you have used your personal experience to show us that your European identity was not decreed ; it was a spontaneous and natural move .
I have taken note of your words ; this is something which we all feel very deeply .
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you , which have always guided your actions ; your attachment to fundamental values .
We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you .
Thank you , Mr President .
( The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m. )
ACP-EU Joint Assembly
The next item is the annual report ( A5-0032 / 2000 ) by Mr Corrie , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999 .
, rapporteur.- Mr President , I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m. , not 9 p.m. , to present this report .
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work .
However , it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight .
Once again , I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place , one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau .
In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one .
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics .
Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern ?
The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb .
In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president , and we wish him well in his retirement .
The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned .
I remember that at the last mid-term review , when I was rapporteur , the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last .
Well , he was wrong , and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances .
I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations .
I pay special tribute to him for his success .
I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé .
I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock ' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations .
I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports .
We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council , and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work .
The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication .
The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights .
We might then see an end to some of the fraud , corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped .
We had , as usual , many debates on countries where there are war situations .
I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge .
The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there .
But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious .
We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations .
This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations , which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle .
Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements .
In Nassau , we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba .
Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP .
All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy , human rights , governance and an independent judiciary are , I am sure , welcome .
I await with interest developments in Cuba .
When Mr Dalmau , the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly , he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known .
We must give them all our support to reach that goal .
Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly .
A number of cases have been highlighted , including the child soldier issue in Sudan , where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states .
I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President .
I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly , particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May .
We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the " them and us " syndrome .
Firstly , I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates .
This I think is the new Convention .
Secondly , the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions , which would allow us to be much more specific in our work .
These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly .
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive .
We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too .
I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries .
I want to see civil society given a louder voice .
But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on .
We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance .
Equally , we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand .
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe .
European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used .
A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to .
The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance , human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission .
I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task .
I beg to move acceptance of this report .
Mr President , let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report .
Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty .
But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU .
An example here could be the field of education , which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future .
I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states , which can promote self-help .
An example here is the problem in Nigeria , which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers .
One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately .
Thank you , Mr Zimmerling : If I am informed correctly , this is the first time you are addressing this House .
Congratulations on your maiden speech : It went really well .
Mr President , it cannot be repeated often enough : since 1975 , the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects .
Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality , and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly , it is an example to the world .
So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999 . The rapporteur , Mr Corrie , has already done so most expertly .
Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s .
They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries .
The after-shocks can still be felt .
ACP cooperation is a dynamic process .
The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI .
At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably , now standing at 71 .
All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa .
Cuba has just knocked at the door , and , if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community , that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself .
So ACP cooperation remains very exciting , and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention .
Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic , cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies , based on respect for human rights , in the ACP states .
That also means strengthening the democratic institutions .
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction .
In the past , the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members , government officials or ambassadors ; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament .
We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100 % in the near future , which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at .
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which , unlike the various crises that arise , largely pass unnoticed .
One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration .
There is one wish on the European Parliament ' s long wish list that will be fulfilled : as we have already heard , the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies .
Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic , economic , social or religious factors , i.e. have a preventive effect .
For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management , and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation .
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction .
But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget .
I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Corrie on his report .
The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years .
That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters , including the WTO , is a triumph of sorts .
Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements .
For example , the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings .
But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2 % threshold .
This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements .
This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement .
Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements .
Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy .
We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements .
We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right .
Mr President , what I want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific .
That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries .
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates , which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence , notably on the former colonial powers .
The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes , and the poor majority does not benefit at all .
Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care , education or drinking water supply .
For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid , and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption .
After all , who protects these deeply corrupt regimes , if not the governments of the rich countries ?
I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority .
Mr President , I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly , Mr Corrie . It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly .
In this speech , I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental .
My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO , which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development .
I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago , partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here .
I refer to Cuba ' s expression of intent , of 2 February , to become a full member of the ACP group of countries .
Following Nassau , a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , Joaquín Miranda , visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place .
That is important , for at least three reasons .
Secondly , we must bear in mind that Cuba ' s application has the support of all the ACP countries .
Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter .
The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there .
Ideally the European Parliament ' s representatives should be able to support Cuba ' s intent at those proceedings , as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing .
Of course , Cuba must meet all the standard conditions , just like any other member .
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it .
It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners .
Cuba ' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle .
I do not have very long in which to speak , and I really only want to take up two questions .
The first is about the fight against poverty , which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States .
We must put a stop to this trend . We must begin by writing off debts .
We must follow up words with action .
I should like us to take a leading role in this work .
My second question concerns the fact that , in many contexts , we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy .
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand , within the context of the new agreement , that working methods should be developed and optimised .
The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion .
I think that is a very good idea indeed , and I fully subscribe to it .
However , we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements .
How do these operate within the European Parliament ' s delegation to the ACP-EU ' s Joint Assembly ?
The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves .
In this context , account ought to be taken of the smaller groups , and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements .
The challenge was immense .
Globalisation , free trade , and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy , were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue .
However , while I welcome the renewal of the agreements , what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close .
The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners .
By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool , in the hands of technocrats , for imposing new sets of conditions , the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty .
We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events .
What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history , values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own ?
In short , this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves , the proof of success .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly , I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the accuracy and rigour of the summary in his report .
The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed .
In view of this positive action , there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work .
We back the rapporteur ' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies , under the aegis of the Joint Assembly , in the six regions of the Convention : the Caribbean , the Pacific and four African regions .
These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas .
Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union ' s development policy .
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting , we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community .
Consistency and action are needed .
The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies .
The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential .
In a wider context , the priorities , as I see it , are to convert poor countries ' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development , as well as control of fraud and corruption .
We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action .
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair .
( DA ) Mr President , I should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the Joint Assembly for its work in 1999 .
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly ' s next meeting , which takes place in March in Nigeria .
The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role , especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development .
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role .
In order to be able to develop , the countries concerned must , however , become actively involved in the global economic system .
With regard to trade with our partners in development , the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries ' special economic and social limitations .
Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with .
I do not agree .
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is , in actual fact , of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned .
It operates too slowly , and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future , because this will operate more flexibly .
It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door .
Once they have done so , we shall adopt a position on the matter .
With regard to Cuba ' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention , the Commission notes that , according to their recent declaration , the ACP States support Cuba ' s application .
The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba , as outlined in the EU ' s common position , but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex .
With regard to the Côte d ' Ivoire , I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities .
With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget , I can say that this is being considered .
For its part , the Commission supports this , but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores .
There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions .
This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty .
Finally , I would refer to the South Africa agreement , which the rapporteur also touched upon .
So the " Grappa War " is over .
Peace has broken out , and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Stabilisation and association agreement with FYROM
For it is no small thing to have a minority of 33 % or even 35 % in one ' s own country .
That country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work , and we should recognise that .
The Commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the Council .
Firstly , there is the regional approach .
I believe that if it is understood properly , the regional approach is both important and necessary .
There has to be a willingness to cooperate .
Provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate , as an opportunity that each country should grasp , then this is the right approach .
On the other hand , cooperation with Bulgaria , and in particular with Greece , has made good progress and I think we should acknowledge that too .
In my view , this regional approach , provided it is understood correctly , i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself , is in fact the right one to adopt .
As I said , it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition .
Secondly , let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union .
In our view , it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now , but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date .
FYROM wants to be told here and now that , in principle , accession will be possible when the time is right .
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined .
I think Commissioner Patten understands that too .
So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks .
Thirdly , I believe that , so far at least , FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly .
I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM .
Mr President , since the start of the Yugoslav wars , the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper .
We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time , which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view .
Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension , both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good .
It was , in fact , in Macedonia that I heard at the time about the Roma population actually not having too bad a time there .
I was unaccustomed to hearing this type of comment about the Roma in Europe .
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia , higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention .
Accessible higher education , with which you have a certain affinity , is an important instrument in the emancipation of population groups . I am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the Protestant university in Amsterdam .
I might never have studied otherwise .
Such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this .
It would be beneficial if we could reorganise this , especially vis-à-vis the neighbouring states .
It is only fair that we should regulate aid to Macedonia properly now .
I am more than happy to include Bulgaria and Romania in this , as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former Yugoslavia , plus Albania .
It is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again , which can quite easily be done with the aid money .
The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union , allowing this country to join , even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future .
I would quote the PHARE programme as an example .
Mr President , the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it .
I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic .
If certain countries wish to use the words " former Yugoslavia " , then that is their business ; others need not feel obliged to copy them .
It will not do to keep us under constant pressure .
Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda ; we have come to expect nothing less of him , and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia .
Mr President , let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda ' s work as rapporteur .
Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia .
We do so in the awareness that this decision , the very first relating to that area , is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans .
This new phase , or rather policy , identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully .
This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued .
And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive .
And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent .
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement .
Mr President , Commissioner , the war in Kosovo has knocked everything off balance .
This is certainly true for the relations between the European Union and the western Balkans .
Since then , expectations have been high . This applies to them and us .
This is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what Europe wants from them at the end of the day ?
Is there any prospect of membership ?
This is very much on their minds .
But here too , within the European Union , expectations are high .
If we do things properly , this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy .
Will the Union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy , for the first time , concerning such a difficult regulation ?
It also remains to be seen whether the European Union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in Bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in Kosovo .
Can we , based on the experiences in Macedonia and in four other countries , improve on this ?
Against this background of extremely high expectations , I do not think that I am exaggerating if I say that this first step , namely the stability and association agreement with Macedonia , is vitally important .
This is not the Union ' s only contribution .
The debate on the Stability Pact , the debate on the CARA programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending .
We are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements , that is to say a medium-term issue .
This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial , because it serves as a model .
I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen .
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia ?
Will it do the same to us ?
This first step is so important because of this model function .
Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason . The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms , namely , the issue of interethnic relations .
There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture .
During the presidential elections , it appeared that things were not running too smoothly , but compared to the rest of the region , Macedonia could serve as a model .
We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians .
This model function also applies to regional cooperation .
I could not agree more with the rapporteur : a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece , and not cutting them off on the other .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we manage this first step successfully , we will have gained a great deal .
If we mess it up , then we will have lost a great deal more .
Mr President , let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle .
I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support .
I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia .
Do not misunderstand me : I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime .
But firstly , these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too , including Macedonia , which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is .
Secondly , the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle , which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive .
So I believe that we should take today ' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions , as stated in Amendment No 10 .
The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions .
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day , maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course .
They have suffered enough , first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc .
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context .
This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region .
That is why it is so important .
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members .
I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy .
Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example .
Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status .
And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia , Macedonia and Bosnia , amongst the Balkan countries , three years hence .
A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia ' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000 .
After nearly 10 years , Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name , and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia .
It is absolutely absurd . Apart from anything else it is offensive , in my opinion , to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece .
This question needs to be resolved urgently .
Why has the Council not informed us of this ?
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia ?
Mr President , Commissioner , the Balkans are not purely a dark cave , politically speaking .
The decidedly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves .
The gruesome escalation of ethnic violence in neighbouring Kosovo did not reach its territory .
Paradoxically , but truly , the war in Kosovo Polje generated exactly the opposite effect : the perilous gap of confidence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority became decidedly smaller .
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority , the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict .
In the eyes of the Albanian minority , the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo ' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme .
This remarkable upshot of the Kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal , political establishment of the Republic of Macedonia the second time round .
Mr Swoboda ' s well-balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level .
Mr President , as one who has been concerned with Macedonia for eight years , I have to contradict Mr Dupuis .
What we are doing here is not hypocritical .
We have reached a propitious moment and I think the Macedonians are glad about it .
Please stop being so unpleasant and pouring cold water on everything .
I think we should take a more positive approach here .
Macedonia did not go through a war .
But it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions , as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries .
It suffered enormously from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo war .
So we must admit that developments in Macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines .
This is a country that has difficult inter-ethnic problems to deal with at home , and is resolving them with increasing success .
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country .
As a sign of our political commitment , we must finally show Macedonia in practice that we are indeed rewarding its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects .
Let me name just two small ones : the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with Kosovo in Blace and the creation of Corridor 8 , from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria .
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report , and it has my wholehearted support .
Mr President , I too would like to compliment Mr Swoboda on his report .
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it .
The report tackles stability in the region in a structural manner . This is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the Republic of Macedonia which we are debating today .
Although the actual implementation of the Stability Pact has not yet started , the Commission has already developed the new instrument , entitled the Stabilisation and Association Agreement .
This marks the beginning of the treaty-based stabilising process for the countries of the former Yugoslavia .
These countries do not yet qualify for a pre-accession agreement .
The present agreement is a kind of pre-pre-agreement , but with a view to joining in future .
The instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent , provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented dynamically , so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained .
Macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match .
It does , however , have the ambition to break free from this image .
This requires internal stability .
The new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms , including a direct role and equality for the Albanian minority .
More than anything , the country needs peace and quiet now , in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity .
We , the social democrats , would urge the opposition to back these ideas .
They need to help support the much-praised Macedonian model .
But the country also - and especially - needs external stability .
What is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable ?
This stability is required in the relations with Yugoslavia , Kosovo , Albania and Bulgaria .
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist .
External stability also means open borders and regional cooperation .
Minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange .
Macedonia ' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries .
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale .
It seems that the Albania factor is being underestimated .
The Union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country .
But what then instead ?
It is the very argument to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania that cause us so much concern , so much so that a passive stance from the Union vis-à-vis Albania is really not acceptable .
What does the Commission intend to do regarding this issue ?
Yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and , as such , a threat to Macedonia ' s stability .
We need to wait and see what happens there .
The mood in Belgrade is becoming less predictable by the day .
We , however , second the Council ' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus .
In this way , at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition , which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations , a shot in the arm .
What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met ?
What else can we do to support this opposition ?
When the USA and NATO and , finally , also the EU , reacted , it was already late , in fact very late .
A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU , among others , has acted earlier and more decisively .
We , the European Union , therefore have a special responsibility to help , support and rebuild the Balkans now .
Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically , politically and in terms of trade .
Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration .
We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly , just as Paolo Costa reported .
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia , and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report .
Macedonia deserves our support , especially in view of the self-sacrificial , disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war .
Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism , it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms .
We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans .
This is an urgent duty for the EU .
The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free .
I am talking about Milosevic .
As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path , Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans , including in Macedonia .
Mr President , the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe ,
All this , in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union .
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe .
On the contrary , I think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de jure full normalisation of FYROM ' s relations with all its neighbours .
Mr President , the agreement we are debating today , as analysed by Mr Swoboda , which I hope we will adopt tomorrow , constitutes the second politically positive step , after the stability pact for the area .
There is another small step , which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for Yugoslavia .
For about 10 years , the situation in the area has been fluid .
Both as an historical period and , in particular , as a political period , 10 years is a very long time .
Under those conditions , then , there has been a real failure .
In that sense , the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow , which contributes towards stability in the area , is de facto a move in the right direction .
In essence , FYROM is a miniature version of the former Yugoslavia , regardless of where one or another minority holds supremacy .
We must be sure that , in seeking allies in the area , we must not always choose anyone who offers .
We must choose those which are moderate , which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area .
In any event , speaking now as a Greek , I want to tell some of the speakers I listened to earlier that much of what was said is fixated on other times and places .
They have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area ; the new and positive conditions which have been created , in very many cases on Greece ' s initiative .
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it , in the entire area , is Greece , and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area .
I say this just so that we know where we stand .
Mr President , I found what Mr Souladakis said much more sensible than the statements by other colleagues from his Member State .
Let me also say quite openly that he is thereby doing huge damage to his own country ' s interests .
It is in our interest to see stability and peace in the Balkans , and there is a chance of that , although the Stability Pact is in danger of becoming a stillborn entity .
I hope that is not the case , but the risk is there .
That is precisely why it is so urgent for the EU to take a bilateral approach to the individual states and for us to open up definite prospects of EU membership for Macedonia .
So I welcome Mr Swoboda ' s excellent report , especially paragraph 12 , which quite clearly maps out a European , an EU , prospect for Macedonia .
Without indulging in any illusions , I believe that is important , it has to happen .
A few years ago , I had the privilege of inviting the current President and Prime Minister here as private individuals .
At the time they were still finding it very difficult to build on their various contacts here .
I am very happy to see they have kept the promise they made at the time : to build up a profoundly European democracy .
We must thank them for playing this important role in moving towards peace , stability and democracy , at a very critical time last year , as I said , and at a strategically crucial point .
So we are not just the donors here , we were also the recipients , and we owe it to the Macedonians to thank them for fulfilling a crucial European mission at that time .
. This has been a very interesting general debate about the Balkans as a whole .
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission 's position on the report .
It is very helpful .
It is an excellent contribution by Mr Swoboda and his colleagues .
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues , a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack , Mr Lagendijk and others .
I am very pleased that at our overall relations with FYROM are in such a good state .
Perhaps Mr Dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of entente cordiale .
That has been helped by our excellent European Union representative in the country .
He has been a great friend to Parliament and a great servant of the Commission .
The imminent commencement of negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement is the most powerful example of our good relations .
So to is the cooperation of FYROM in the rebuilding of Kosovo .
I am grateful to the authorities in Macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in Kosovo .
I saw the newly-elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely impressed , as others have been , by his commitment to multi-ethnicity and pluralism .
Let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as Mr Lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest .
The Council adopted on 24 January this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
This represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western Balkans region initiated by the Commission in May 1999 .
Let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives .
They cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with FYROM .
They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement .
They cover provisions on the movement of workers , freedom of establishment , supply of services , current payments and movement of capital .
We are now making in the Commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in March .
I am due to visit FYROM in the second week in March .
I hope to be able to set the process in motion then , although the formal negotiations will start very shortly thereafter .
At the time of that visit I will also , as recommended by honourable Members and others , be upgrading our representation in FYROM .
The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators .
The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now , given the time needed for ratification in Member States ' parliaments .
I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution .
I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union .
That has never been the intention .
The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM , before all the others , is evidence that we can and do differentiate .
On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension .
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement .
It will reflect the European Union 's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions .
We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent .
I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and , especially , at the loss of association with the PHARE name .
I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score .
I will take another look at the issue , although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion .
I want to stress , however , that whatever the programme is called , our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever .
In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly .
I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Agreement on comitology
During the trialogue held on 6 October 1999 in Strasbourg , the Presidents of the European Parliament and the Commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon .
We believe we have respected that commitment , and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the Commission .
Hitherto , such information had been supplied on paper and unsystematically , and was of no use to our services ; and indeed this was often the fault of Parliament itself .
But we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure .
Therefore , the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure , including possible action by the committee responsible .
I want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not , we must wait and see how it works in practice .
Mr President , comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means .
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies , which is the way things used to be .
In fact , it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission .
The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures .
Up until the Amsterdam Treaty , there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures , which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens .
On the contrary , for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed .
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors .
It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny .
Now , following the Amsterdam Treaty , the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement .
Mrs Frassoni , our rapporteur , has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament .
A key problem is the time factor .
When the European Parliament is informed , it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks , should it so wish .
Nevertheless , the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react .
Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties , which I and my group can only support in full .
I just have one more request .
In the German version , paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification , which I would also like to see in the printed version later .
In my view , instead of " weitergeführt werden müssen " the wording should be " erhalten bleiben müssen " .
The German version is not very clear here .
I would ask for that to be checked again .
For the rest , I warmly thank our rapporteur .
It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions .
Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved , which are far from matching Parliament ' s original position on the issue of comitology .
Let us remember what is at stake here .
Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement .
Firstly , the whole system is obscure .
It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees .
Here is a real step forward , in the new system that has been agreed .
We are to know who is on each committee .
We are to know when they meet .
We are to get the agendas .
We are to get the documents that are sent to them .
The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex .
So that is at least a step forward .
Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission . We adopt legislation in the European Union .
Here too there is at least some progress .
That is a more reasonable system .
That , too , is a step forward .
But on our other two criticisms , we are less satisfied .
The legislative authority , Council and Parliament , should be equal .
We confer implementing powers on the Commission , but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure .
Parliament has no equivalent power .
True , we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system .
We are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee .
We will have the chance to scrutinise , to debate , to question .
But we will only have the right to formally challenge the Commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the Commission in the legislation .
In other words , we can challenge the measure for being ultra-vires but not on its content .
And in a democracy , Parliament should be able to challenge the content .
Not that we do so every week .
We are not seeking to immerse ourselves in implementing decisions , but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary .
That is lacking in this new system , or at least is only there in embryonic form .
That is not correct .
Both branches adopt the legislation - Council and Parliament - that confers implementing powers on the Commission .
If such implementing measures are referred back , it should be to both branches , not to one branch alone .
Overall we have a system which has made some progress .
The supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome , but that could not change the basic decision of the Council .
Even here , we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the Plumb-Delors agreement as part of the overall compromise .
We have been willing to relinquish the provisions in that .
We shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision .
We must be very vigilant .
So it is a step forward .
My group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward .
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni .
We recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years ' time .
If we want a Union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject .
Mr President , first I want to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Frassoni , for her work .
It is never easy working on comitology .
Mrs Schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic , something we have long talked about .
Certainly the process has always been very complex , as a result of historical decisions , and these must eventually be rationalised .
In my opinion , the agreement reached between Commission and Parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process .
From our point of view , it satisfies the fundamental interests of Parliament .
Mr Corbett set out Parliament ' s concerns .
He says some of them have been satisfied and others have not .
I would say the ones the Commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied .
Mr Corbett is raising issues the Council decision does not cover , and unfortunately we can go no further on those .
So how far have we come ?
There is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point , highlighted by Mrs Frassoni , given that we now have an automatic information system .
I think this is a good agreement .
It is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process .
From here on things are going to be easier .
But the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the Plumb / Delors Agreement .
Mr Corbett referred to that , but the new model is certainly much more complex , different because the situation is now different , and , in our opinion , much more coherent .
We have made a start , and we hope the work will produce some excellent results .
We think there are other positive advances too .
From the Commission ' s point of view , our conclusion is that this is a good agreement , and we want to thank the Members of Parliament who worked on it - especially Mrs Frassoni .
We hope that this new climate means we have achieved the result we were seeking , which is greater transparency and better information about the decisions of the Commission as an executive .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Solbes Mira .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure
Therefore , if the regulation is adopted , the estimate which is due to appear in March 2000 , the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year , will be made using the new system .
We know the Member States have done their duty - if I can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with ESA 95 , and they have already published their corresponding estimates .
In addition to incorporating a new methodology , this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations , on account of the aforesaid methodological changes , and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates .
These changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the Member States ' national accounting .
I will now describe , very briefly , the five areas where the most important changes may occur .
First , the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by ' government institutional sector ' under ESA 95 .
This is important , since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government .
The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States ' government deficits .
Secondly , the deficit - or , if applicable , the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector ' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively
Thirdly , government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector , as defined in ESA 95 .
Fourthly , government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95 , as are the flows or interest stemming from assets / liabilities .
Fifthly and finally , the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices , estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts ' definitions .
We have already heard about the various aspects involved .
What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable .
We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another .
It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons .
Firstly , for the single market .
It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends .
Secondly , for economic and monetary union .
The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level .
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits .
This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely .
These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries , since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit .
Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit .
It is good that the procedure exists .
We need it because it lends our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility .
The citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met .
Thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously .
Another important point is that we must do all we can , not just to prevent excessive deficits , but also to further reduce public deficits .
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate !
We are currently holding a debate in my own country on whether the former minister for finance actually gave us accurate information on the deficit .
In my country , Austria , new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach .
Mr President , the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable .
This is of great importance , especially in the light of European unification and the completion of the internal market .
This is why this report is also so politically charged : a report , by the way , on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly .
It also inspires a few political comments .
The Stability Pact is a given in Europe .
All countries participating in the euro have committed themselves , in the medium term , to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus .
The stronger the position of the participating countries , the stronger the euro will be .
As a result , the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded , not even in a bad economic climate . This is the theory behind it , anyway .
We have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be stringently met .
That is of great importance in order to turn the EMU into a success , now and in the future .
Strict compliance with the Stability Pact can thus contribute to a culture of stability within all EMU Member States .
Various Member States have taken one-off measures to be able to meet the criteria .
We are of the opinion that the Member States ' budget policy should be strictly supervised , to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times .
A drop in standards should not be allowed .
We are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised .
Indeed , we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations .
.
( ES ) Mr President , many thanks , first of all , to the rapporteur for his splendid work .
It was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and I think Mr Knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism .
I just mention that to complete the view of the process .
Secondly , I would like to thank Mr Knörr for his speediness .
He has done really good work in a very short time .
This is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently .
What we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable .
Obviously , the fact that Parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the March figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria .
That being so , I believe the final result will be better .
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed .
This regulation is purely instrumental .
It does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised .
But we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem .
But we see no reason to lower our guard .
We must press on in that direction because we know it is vital .
So , once again - and finally - I want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better comparability .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Solbes Mira .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
Increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro
It is a definite and concrete issue . It is about our common currency .
How many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs ?
We cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited .
The ECB , ECOFIN , Europol , OLAF and the Commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation .
It is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced .
It is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions .
This is something which Parliament has said it wants to see added .
Any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency , and that country would be accountable , both morally and economically , if its actions were to contribute to a delay .
A country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself .
On 1 January 2002 the euro will be in circulation .
The whole of the Union must have the same protection , a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting , not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation .
It is important that , in time , there should be a more or less similar-looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries .
Trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences .
Quite simply , we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty .
The denominations of the euro are well known .
Modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves .
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal , for example in regard to jurisdiction , the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime .
There are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting , this being a measure which we would encourage .
The new applicant States are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations .
It has taken two years for the Council and the Commission to produce this proposal .
It is essential that the decision should now be taken in March .
To delay , or perhaps even risk damage to the euro , would be indefensible . It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new , unfamiliar notes .
In particular , it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone , where people are less familiar with the new currency .
The protective measures cover these countries too , and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight .
The present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character , accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others .
The Council must now convene in March and make the relevant decision .
Thank you for listening .
Thank you , too , those who contributed to this matter ' s being dealt with swiftly .
I am thinking in particular of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
The euro will enter into circulation on 1 January 2002 and will become one of the world ' s most important reserve currencies .
Due to its importance on a world scale , the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery .
This draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each Member State simpler and more effective .
It also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation , which will fill a gap in legislation in some Member States .
I expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation .
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective , adequate penal sanctions , which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision .
Mr President , this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward , with legislation to be applied by all fifteen Member States at the same time .
We are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the European Union as an area of freedom , security and justice , as expressed at Tampere .
Mr President , I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made .
All that is indeed very true and correct . It is easy to counterfeit the euro .
We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history .
It is a highly complex problem .
If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation .
Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people .
So what is the European Union doing about it ?
The manner in which the Council , which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe , consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy .
We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time , incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment .
Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex , difficult and , at times , contradictory Council document in the space of three months .
So let me state quite clearly here , on behalf of my group , that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this .
We concluded that it is not , but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure .
This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress .
I leave it to the assembled company in this Chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a European Union based on judicial cooperation .
Thank you for your attention during our night sitting together .
Mr President , the launch of the euro could well be a heaven-sent opportunity for counterfeiters .
The fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references , and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article .
So the Council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions , primarily criminal , applicable in all the countries of Europe , against offences of this kind .
No doubt the Council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that Member States adopt national legislation to that effect .
That is what I would have preferred , personally .
But , probably through lack of confidence in the zeal of certain members , the Council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at European level : a framework decision .
The draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this lacuna by referring to Articles 31 and 34 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Treaty .
However , I find these passports inadequate .
Article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases , specifically restricted to organised crime , terrorism and drug trafficking .
Counterfeiting is not on the list .
Article 34 , a product of the Treaty of Amsterdam , only lays down the new form of a framework decision , and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the European Union .
So we come back to the previous problem .
In other words , the Council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis .
In a way , this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty , at the time , in presenting the Maastricht Treaty to the voters .
I would also like to make a more general point .
Not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part-session .
But there has been nothing for a year .
Just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting .
However , there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved .
Mr President , for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money .
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here .
I should like to take over the baton from the previous speaker .
There are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions , because the point of departure is , of course , that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern .
Criminal law is part of each individual nation ' s own cultural tradition , and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts .
She would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the EU .
But the problem is that there is no legal basis for this , and with good reason , because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction .
In that context , I want to ask the following question of the Commission ' s and the Council ' s representatives : is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate ?
What of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the Member States ' obligations are laid down in detail . There is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation .
In my view , this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis .
I should like an answer from the Commission and the Council , for I consider it obvious that Article 31 does not supply the relevant legal basis .
We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it .
We are also concerned with the question of cooperation .
We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB , the national central banks , the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro .
I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work .
In the same context , we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock , together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities .
Aside from the report , which we welcome , many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved .
I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification .
Mr President , Mrs Cederschiöld , ladies and gentlemen , how safe is the euro ?
That is , after all , a question the people often ask .
And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002 , the date when they will have euros in their pockets .
For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but , in fact , also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting .
That too is a concern of the people , for , as has rightly been said , this will be a new currency for them , new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used .
Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area , and even beyond Europe , as a reserve currency .
They will need time to get used to that too .
So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting .
And that is what we are discussing at this late hour .
This really is a subject that is close to the citizen , so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour .
But that cannot be helped .
Of course , the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time .
After all , it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting .
That is what this framework decision is about .
I certainly appreciate that .
The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences .
It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law .
In that respect we must recognise this innovation , this step , even if , as Mr Schulz just pointed out , simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step .
In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty , the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here .
The framework decision will , however , have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future .
The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol .
As Mr Karas just pointed out , a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro , to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million .
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use , a large amount ; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Schreyer .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m. )
Resumption of the sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you , Mr President , in fact conceals a huge window which , if the curtain were drawn back , would afford a wonderful view over the river .
But what is to prevent us , before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting , opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you ?
I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers .
Thank you very much Mr Onesta , I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort .
I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being .
In the meantime , I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter , technically speaking .
If so , then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light !
UCITS
( SV ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe .
As a new Member of the European Parliament , it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter .
There was a good deal of agreement within the committee , apart from on a matter which , too , I hope it will be possible to solve .
The issue of UCITS may appear difficult , technical and a political minefield .
I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for .
It is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors ' need for protection and security .
In the course of the 1980s , most markets in Europe underwent drastic deregulation .
As a result , the national money and bond markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years .
Collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank .
In my own country , more than 60 per cent of Swedes save with a variety of funds .
The security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed .
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed .
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated .
New types of funds have been introduced in the various Member States which are not permitted to market their units in other Member States .
Obviously , this inhibits competition and innovation and restricts the public ' s range of savings options .
The Commission ' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts .
The first concerns the product , that is to say the funds . The other concerns the collective investment undertakings .
Special risk-spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments , involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria .
In addition , the Commission ' s proposal puts forward special risk-spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index , a so-called index fund .
The committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the Commission ' s proposal more stringent .
To guarantee transparency and prudence , investments in non-harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria , for example a transparency requirement and investor protection , are introduced .
In addition , quantitative criteria ( risk exposure ) should be introduced .
Moving on now , then , to the point where there is ( or , I hope , was ) a lack of agreement , namely OTC derivatives .
The Commission ' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets ( so-called OTC derivatives ) .
In recent years , the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the Member States .
It is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments .
The definitions ' standardised futures contracts ' and ' standardised options ' should therefore be combined to form a new definition , ' financial derivative instruments ' , which also covers OTC derivatives .
Investment in OTC derivatives , however , should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced .
They are very important in this case . They must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors .
The Commission ' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage UCITS , that is to say management companies .
The rules for management companies , for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business , are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations .
A crucial point is that rules are proposed for so-called simplified prospectuses .
Relevant information must be given to prospective unit-holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country .
In this regard , too , the committee is prepared to go further than the Commission .
A question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies .
There are different views on this .
One of the most important things , for me , personally , is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under .
During the months that I have been working on this report , one very clear demand has emerged , both from industry and from those who represent the consumer .
The current situation is not good .
Both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of Europe .
I believe that today ' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors .
I just want to conclude by saying that a number of Members of Parliament think that the present proposal goes too far , while others think that I am not sufficiently liberal .
To them I just want to say , as the English expression goes , ' You can ' t have it all . '
.
Mr President , at the outset I wish to place on the official record of the House my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by Mr Schmidt , our rapporteur .
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament .
We failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter .
In a short space of time Mr Schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within Parliament .
I thank him for that .
There is little disagreement amongst Members with regard to the first proposal .
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities .
However , it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern .
I have a number of ideas which should be put across .
Firstly , the idea of an EU passport for management companies is to be welcomed ; and the home-state approval rule is also to be welcomed .
However , instead of imposing a new regime , we could have used the Investment Services Directive as the analogy for this regime .
It seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity .
Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries ' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe .
We will have to revisit this issue again in the near future .
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term , if not for the long term .
As indicated by the rapporteur , we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament .
This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation , albeit in a prudent manner .
I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution .
However , the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political , social and personal problem with incalculable consequences .
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings .
Firstly , there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive .
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments .
Secondly , the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions , both within my Group and between the groups .
We have achieved a compromise solution .
Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products .
It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market , namely the famous OTC derivatives .
We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this , or so we believe , which I welcome .
As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage , I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament .
The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House . This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency .
We are therefore faced with two options . We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process .
Mr President , the Socialist Group supports the Commission ' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services .
Obviously , in the wake of the introduction of the euro , we need to create an integrated European financial market which is similar to the American and Japanese markets .
The debates on UCITS gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Olle Schmidt , and also Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , for their constructive approach .
The Socialists recognise the importance of the investment fund industry to the development of our economies and to the allocation of resources .
But the world of international finance is a dangerous one .
The capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses .
There is at present a surfeit of cash looking for a home .
In 1999 , the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over-stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions , pushing up the prices of long-term financial and real assets .
And as international financial activity speeds up , the risks increase .
The legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the European financial markets .
By definition , investment funds use other people ' s money .
The legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses .
There is no freedom without rules .
We have done away with so-called master-feeder structures .
These feeder funds exist in the United States , which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system .
The European market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems .
The Socialists , like the Commission , question the advisability of allowing investment funds to invest in so-called over-the-counter derivatives , i.e. products negotiated between professionals by private contract .
As these transactions are generally not subject to prudential control , the risks are all the more obvious .
The Socialist Group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors .
By adopting these amendments , Parliament will allow recourse to OTC derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors .
Mr President , there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance .
This principle should not only guide the public sector , it should also guide the private sector , especially financial undertakings .
I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure , safer , higher returns .
Despite their image of danger , derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance .
Is this speculative ?
Not at all .
Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident : they have good management , good prospects and they are good investments .
Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse , as it did in 1987 .
You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash , but that would be to waste your research into the winners .
It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall .
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls .
In exchange , you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets .
In this case , which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers , you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk .
That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund .
History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation .
Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers .
These are of course the returns after deducting all losses .
Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off .
This is what we should be concerned about here today .
Mr President , the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe , including the most sophisticated forms of investment .
We do not , in principle , oppose this industry .
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group .
But we make no bones about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole .
We shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised .
For years certain countries , including Great Britain , have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens .
They even reject the strict minimum , i.e. the Monti package proposed by the Commission in Brussels .
This attitude is turning Europe into a machine which exempts investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income , with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies .
We must put an end to this .
By blocking the demands of the financial industry , the European Parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall .
Mr President , the 1985 directive introduced a sort of European visa for certain types of UCITS which could be marketed throughout the Union .
Since then , the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve ; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation , they have exploded exponentially and without restraint .
This brings us to the two proposals for directives .
The second proposal , on which the report is excellent , does not require any particular comment . It aims to strengthen consumer protection and security .
That is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled ; it favours all the languages of the Community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it .
The same cannot be said of the first proposal .
We might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation .
However , we are unable to agree to the text of the report , although I welcome the work carried out by Mr Schmidt , for several reasons .
We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35 % ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , this is a vital issue for Europe .
A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings .
I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt ' s report brings us .
UCITS are a success story within the European Union .
They are a safe product , traded cross-border .
But it is time for the legislation to be updated .
Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here .
It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt ' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament .
But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue .
The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives .
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS .
We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation .
We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans .
Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives .
We must not be afraid to go forward , to react to changes in the market .
Yes , we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers .
The report gives very adequate protection for consumers .
But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives .
I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts , which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings .
I salute Mr Schmidt .
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation .
If we open this curtain , then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away .
We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting .
However , I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies .
Mr President , the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989 , mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors .
The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold .
There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world .
However , the directive is ten years old and , now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available , it is somewhat outdated .
The Commission proposals being debated here will give it the face-lift it needs .
In addition , investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund .
My Amendment No 47 is therefore a warning for amateurs .
This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice .
At the same time , it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings , particularly those we are concerned with today .
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion , thereby accounting for roughly 75 % of all funds assets .
Hence the Commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives , and I must say that I actually have every confidence in the Commission ' s proposal .
This therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products .
Why do we not take our cue from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive , Article 11 for example , which relates to good practice ?
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions .
The preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the European investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units .
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations , the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market .
And the more consumers invest , the brighter the prospects will be in the European business money markets .
It is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital-based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based , and , thus , opportunities for growth and investment will also improve .
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here .
Although in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment , the debate we had was not the easiest one .
For me personally at least , difficulties were caused by the directive ' s technical division into two different proposals , which certainly did not make it easier to familiarise oneself with this very difficult technical subject .
However , I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals .
Firstly , I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments .
As regards derivatives , I consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike Mrs Randzio-Plath , for example .
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before .
Mr President , I see two problems with this morning ' s debate .
Firstly , when I came to this Parliament many years ago I was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a Liberal .
Now I have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the Luxembourg Members are in the Chamber at one time - and they are .
Firstly , I welcome proposal No 1 . It simplifies things and brings things up to date .
I think many of the British Members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report .
We support the Schmidt report on proposal No 1 , but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks .
We believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward .
Secondly , we consider proposal No 2 to be very confused .
It is difficult to understand , and we think the Commission would be well advised to look at it again .
If further regulation is needed , we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive .
In particular , we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether .
We ask the Commission to look again at these proposals .
Mr President , money does not smell , as the Romans would say .
The important thing is for money to generate more money .
In this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in tranquillity .
Pensioners will , in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal .
Indeed , whilst the young are penniless , the elderly have accumulated money and , since they are keen to turn it to good advantage , harbour great hopes for this directive .
Since the approval of Directive 85 / 611 , the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules .
The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors , which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro .
Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds , the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned .
The two proposals form a coherent whole .
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an ' undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities ' ( UCITS ) can invest .
As already remarked in this session , UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets .
Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets , in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration , protected by appropriate supervision .
Since diverse types of investment are permitted , private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques .
The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector .
The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas .
I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 18 and 20 , although the wording needs to be adapted .
I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17 , 36 and 45 .
I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47 .
All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal .
The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these , with certain changes in the wording .
The Commission is in favour of codification and will , in the foreseeable future , once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative , concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version .
However , I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands .
Amendment No 8 because the proposed , general reference to assets ' covered by this directive ' , instead of the more precise reference to assets ' mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive ' , hinders implementation .
This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States , which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive .
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms .
Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions .
We cannot , therefore , adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason .
Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive .
I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22 , paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason .
This goes against the Commission ' s intention to widen the scope of investments , and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements .
The key issue regarding the first proposal , however , is Parliament ' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes .
The Commission points out that , according to the national legislation of some Member States , the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised .
However , the Commission will be suspending its position , given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments .
I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems , because they are not liquid , the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks .
It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and , at the same time , freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments .
By rejecting the rapporteur ' s Amendment No 39 , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council .
The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed , in theory , to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market .
In practice , access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments .
This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments .
As far as the second proposal is concerned , I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments .
The application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities , better known as ISD , is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion .
Amendment No 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities .
Amendment No 35 cannot be accepted because legally , it cannot command any authority .
Management companies which are denied access to a Member State would need to re-incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another Member State .
I would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few Members this morning and , Mr President , with your permission , I will do this in English .
Furthermore the proposal put forward by Mr Crowley would require a change of the ISD which at present - as I am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business .
Lastly , his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities .
As regards the question put by Mr Huhne , his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations .
But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21 ( 1 ) of Directive 611 / 85 on UCITS .
So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible .
A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management .
That is also something which is allowed under present legislation .
I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne ' s question .
In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals .
The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product , while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider , and on prospectuses for UCITS .
The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council .
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but , as is well-known , must also deal with the Council .
That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals .
Lastly , Mr Balfe has complained that there are , in his opinion , too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward .
These are the reasons why the Commission believes , because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field , that these various limits are necessary .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States
It is thus , as you can see , a very important draft , that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance .
In actual fact , there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention , and over certain provisions contained therein .
Some of these differences have already been ironed out , but others persist .
Mr President , international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross-border crime and crimes which are committed in one State , but the evidence for which is to be found in another .
These are thus extremely important questions , which we hope that the Council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion .
As regards other aspects of this subject , Mr President , I would refer you to my written report .
- ( ES ) Mr President , I want to start by saying that I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party which I represent on this issue .
I should like to draw attention to the fact that the Council is not present today .
By contrast , I welcome the attentive presence of Commissioner Vitorino , as has consistently been the case since his appointment . This leads me to another point .
I condemn this , as well as the Council ' s absence .
These are serious matters on which this House must act .
We are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance .
A political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out .
This is why this report is so important .
It represents a step towards the area of freedom , security and , particularly , justice to which we all aspire . It is also an important step towards European natural justice .
Mr President , as the rapporteur said , this House has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the Convention .
The regulation of phone tapping in the Council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate .
Yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field . In fact , we are aware that these are already happening widely .
The other point which I must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video conferencing with regard to accused persons .
Apart from a few exceptions , the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party will vote in favour of the committee ' s amendments , and of course our own .
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law .
This is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law , which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of Europe we want to see .
Mr President , committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary , but not amendments from individual Members .
Mr Schulz should be aware of this .
Crime in the European Union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step-by-step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs .
The European Parliament is certainly not to blame for this .
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree .
As a result , the European Parliament is faced with an almost impossible task .
One has to content oneself with the idea that all means , however slight , must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance .
I would therefore make an urgent appeal to the Council of Ministers to finally face reality , that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law .
If not , we will be fighting a running battle .
I therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the EU Member States in the first instance .
In my opinion , this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all Member States .
As long as this harmonisation has not been achieved , however , we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance .
The content of my amendment is , in fact , echoed in Amendment No 43 , which also stipulates this condition of accrual .
This condition of accrual is essential since , in my opinion , the principle of nulla poena sine lege , legality in criminal law , must be observed .
As such , any request for legal assistance concerning a hypothetical action which is not a crime in the petitioned Member State contravenes this principle of legality and thus the fundamental principles of justice in the petitioned Member State .
Hence , it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted .
If , however , we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security , we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation .
Mr President , my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs .
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government .
The present proposal is complex , because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship .
It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council ' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired .
In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro , the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings .
Thanks to the agreement , it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests , whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States .
The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court .
Additional measures are hence required , such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used .
The fact that the Council ' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group .
There are certainly no restrictions in its scope .
As such , the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime .
In fact , it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law .
It is , therefore , conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust .
Mr President , the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned .
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments .
The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament .
We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules , especially procedural ones , which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community .
I believe that this first half of the year , in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council , provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration .
It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79 , which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences .
Mr President , confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level , the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible .
Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council ' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions , inconsistent propositions and omissions .
It is clear that the justice sector , more than any other , cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner .
The report contains arguments that are too disparate , which do not link together smoothly , and everything thus hinges on approximations .
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties . Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions .
The committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented , and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence .
This is the problem , and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the Council , which is one we find completely unsatisfactory .
In my Group , there are undoubtedly different views of Mr Di Pietro ' s report .
I agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work , which has been carried out under difficult conditions .
The Danish Members of the Group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will , on the contrary , be supporting a number of amendments , especially those tabled by the Greens .
There are two reasons why we are saying no .
Firstly , these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and , to my mind , the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty , which have not been fully realised .
This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support .
The other main reason , however , is that , even though we are concerned here with a Convention ( and therefore with international cooperation ) , there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal .
And the trend is towards creating , in the longer term , a common European area of jurisdiction , common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice .
We would warn against that trend .
I personally find it unacceptable , for example , for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation .
Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link .
These are nevertheless minor flaws , which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote .
The rapporteur has made laudable efforts , which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him .
The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account .
This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse .
It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing , but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring .
This is a distant goal , but is one that can be attained in stages .
The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States , but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward , as it is a step in the right direction .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement .
It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal .
The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty .
Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters .
Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely , and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights .
Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement .
Not only should this be deleted , the whole interception title should be scrapped .
An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation .
The Council proposal containing those requirements , ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report .
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception , and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at .
I would also like to ask : given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception , does this include Parliament ' s in-house service ?
Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very , very shoddy grounds ?
Furthermore , in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences .
This leaves it wide open to abuse .
Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof , something which is recognised in international , fundamental law , the presumption of innocence is essential .
That is not guaranteed .
Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence , a basic principle of international fundamental rights .
This issue is extremely serious .
In that sense , the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important .
What did I understand on reading the related texts ?
In my opinion , the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work .
It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today .
Nevertheless , it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries , defendants and citizens , a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly .
I should like , however , to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law .
How can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis ?
On 14 December 1999 , a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train , crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother .
Corinne Caillaux , who had probably been raped , was found with her throat cut and covered in stab wounds in the lavatories on the train .
Rezala should never have been in France . He arrived from Algeria at a time when , according to the authorities , immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come .
He should never have stayed in France , having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences , which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country .
He should never have been free because 14 charges of theft , violence and rape had been brought against him , one of which was for the rape of a minor .
He should never have been able to escape from France , but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and European frontiers have more holes than a sieve .
He should never have arrived in Spain , where he mugged a woman at knifepoint and yet was immediately released by the Spanish authorities .
Today , thanks to the complex networks of sexual deviants , he is in Portugal .
Portugal refuses to extradite him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in France than that provided for in the Portuguese penal code .
I should like to ask the Portuguese minister , the President-in-Office of the Council , to put a stop to this scandal at once .
I should like to ask the House to wake up , at long last , to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment , not the yobs , bears full responsibility .
Mr President , this agreement deals with a sensitive issue : cooperation in the field of criminal law .
It is therefore understandable that the Council finds it difficult to agree .
Successful application of this agreement by the Member States requires unanimity within the Council .
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice .
This , however , does not mean that the Council can work on this anonymously .
Quite the reverse , in fact . The Council ' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law .
The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test .
Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but , above all , by the national parliaments , is therefore of key importance .
Mr Di Pietro ' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications , amongst other things , is understandable , although very strict .
The text of Article 18 is ambiguous : he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter ' s prior authorisation .
In this way , Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State .
I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text .
The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will , however , despite hesitation , not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote .
This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship .
On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting .
As for videoconferencing , more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded .
The procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , legislating in criminal matters is often countered , wrongly , with arguments of individual freedom and security .
Is one secure when freedoms are no longer guaranteed ?
Is one free when security is no longer assured ?
Modern criminal law revolves around the quest for a balance , a dialogue between security and freedom .
And this dialogue is open-ended ; it adapts to the demands of the day .
Nowadays , certain forms of crime are cross-border crimes and it is , of course , in the interests of the Member States to improve cooperation so that they can crack down on them .
But the Council ' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts .
First , the form : the draft convention is vague in the extreme , and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society .
It is not just a question of style .
We are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter .
It makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ .
I should like to stress this point because it is paramount .
It is nothing less than legal torture .
Other European countries , on the other hand , do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt .
I turn to Mr Schulz in confirming that we always submit amendments not on a personal basis or for personal motives , but in connection with general political concerns .
If it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or researching these , they can be found with the rapporteurs , among them the author of the report on this convention .
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks .
In brief , this Parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters ; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters .
We need hard and fast rules .
The Council has behaved in an unseemly manner , changing tack in mid-course , and is nowhere to be seen .
We would , on the other hand , like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for attending the debate held in this Chamber .
.
Mr President , the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council .
Most say it is about time .
According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997 , the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997 .
More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force , given the fact that this requires Member States ' ratification .
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing .
This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance .
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament .
It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States .
This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court .
Furthermore , requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities .
It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations .
However , one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence .
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe ' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg .
It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights , work on which has just begun .
We must recognise that Article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision .
The article was carefully crafted in Council in very lengthy discussions , in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered .
The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal .
However , we must be realistic .
The text we have is the result of the mixture of the institutional set-ups foreseen for judicial cooperation in criminal matters under both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties respectively .
This is what we have , and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken .
I am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the Member States will ease the road we have ahead of us .
Apart from that , the Tampere European Council has already indicated in which direction we , in the Commission , should go .
Among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting-up of the Euro Just project .
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields .
I do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years .
I am counting more on the European Parliament to be not only a critical observer , as it has been in this case , but also an active player in taking the Union forward in the fight against crime .
VOTE
Madam President , my apologies , I was looking at Amendment No 36 , which logically precedes Amendment No 37 .
But , you are right , we are discussing Amendment No 37 and here too we have a similar problem .
It is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating .
The text therefore reads : ' instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation ' .
My apologies once again for my mistake .
Are there any objections to this oral amendment ?
( Parliament adopted the oral amendment )
( Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions in two separate votes )
I feel that this behaviour , particularly in your presence , is unacceptable and totally repugnant , especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign .
Therefore , particularly out of respect for you , I must say that I do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this .
I was told that this was a personal response .
Note will be taken of it in the Minutes .
I see that Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject .
We are not going to enter into a debate now .
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote .
Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24
Madam President , I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council .
I also want to mention the translation problems , of which I will give just one example , as we do not have much time .
Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts .
Amendment No 83 in Italian , which is the original version , states that ' il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno ' .
The term ' legale esterno ' has been translated into French as ' avocat neutre ' . I have no idea what an ' avocat neutre ' is .
It rather seems like a contradiction in terms .
However , in the Spanish version the ' abogado ' has disappeared completely .
Madam President , you have said several times that this is a very serious problem .
The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced .
Quite , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi , this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying .
We shall address this problem and check all the translations .
I should like you , Madam President , to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future .
Quite , I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on .
Relating to Amendment No 31
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )

But I did notice a drop in alertness and when we debated the amendments of our Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , you mentioned the Greens on their own in every instance .
We are a group of unity in diversity . We want to bring this across in Parliament .
I would ask you to use the full name of our Group .
Very well , I shall do so .

Report ( A5-0032 / 2000 ) by Mr Corrie , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the results of the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Relating to Amendment No 6
. ( DE ) Madam President , I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification , because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations .
I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this .
This clarification would certainly meet with our approval .
Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment ?
( Parliament agreed to the oral amendment ) - Relating to Amendment No 9
I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM .
We have encountered several problems in some of the other languages , but have not been able to check all of these , and I would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type .
The regulation of investments in transferable securities , the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners , is thus a major step forward for the European Union .
Report by Olle Schmidt ( A5-0025 / 2000 )
. ( SV ) Olle Schmidt ' s report is an improvement on the Commission ' s proposal .
In its present form , the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets , in spite of the fact that what is most important is to restrain them .
Like the whole of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , I have therefore voted against the proposal to amend Directive No 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend Directive No 2 .
Brok report ( A5-0029 / 2000 )
Madam President , there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the European Union .
We have before us Malta and Cyprus , which are two States keen to become members .
. ( FR ) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta , whose accession is vital to the future of the European Union in the Mediterranean .
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for Cyprus and Malta , starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years ( 2000-2004 ) .
The proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire .
On a more general note , it is true that the socio-economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries .
However , they have received technical assistance and financial aid from the European Union in order to transpose the acquis communautaire .
Until 1999 , this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols ( B7-4011 ) .
Both countries also qualify for financial aid under the MEDA programme ( B7-4012 ) .
This proposal for a regulation is supposed to be one of these legal bases !
. I welcome Mr Brok ' s report supporting with amendments the Commission ' s proposals seeking to prepare Cyprus and Malta for EU membership .
The package will grant around Euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year .
It is , however , regrettable that the Commission has eschewed multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis .
This is bound to have an impact on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan spending .
The funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the Community ' acquis ' .
Given the already advanced state of these two countries , compared to other applicants , this should easily allow them to be ' technically and administratively ' ready for membership at the end of the 5-year programme .
Cederschiöld report ( A5-0020 / 2000 )
. ( FR ) As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs during the last parliamentary term , I welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency .
The Union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting .
Consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets , bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away .
And the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify .
The European information centres , which are already playing a vital role in raising public awareness of the single currency , should step up their campaigns to raise public awareness of counterfeiting .
On another level , we must ensure that Community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting .
The purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the International Convention for the Suppression of Counterfeiting Currency of 20 April 1929 and to facilitate its application by the Member States .
Each Member State must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable .
These offences must be punishable even if they relate to banknotes and coins denominated in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 January 2002 .
This is a basic element of the decision .
I cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected .
We must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years !
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation .
Although this framework decision is a step in the right direction , it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards .
There is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems .
That brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the European Council in Tampere .
The risk of counterfeiting increases . Counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire EU ; the punishment must therefore be the same in each Member State .
The harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be legitimised against the background of problems of one ' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity .
We are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the abandonment of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such flimsy grounds . Instead , the focus should be upon preventing the real problem .
. I welcome this proposal to protect the Euro against forgers .
When the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 January 2002 , everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the Euro .
Di Pietro report ( A5-0019 / 2000 )
. Commissioner Prodi pointed out that ' Africa is our responsibility ' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries .
I worked in Africa 30 years ago , and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic .
Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year , approximately 200 000 died in wars .
In Zambia 25 % of teachers have died of AIDS .
In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today .
Our policies in Africa lack coherence .
There is huge duplication of effort .
Furthermore , the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development .
It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent .
. ( FR ) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005 , the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a ' global actor ' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world .
What should this global actor ' s objective be ?
Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of ' to defend the countries of Europe better ' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations .
And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen .
All we find are vague phrases about ' strategic partnerships ' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it .
The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing .
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union , a little-known , almost always implicit flaw , but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens ' loss of interest .
There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines .
. ( FR ) I share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate .
I do , of course , understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure ....
However , experience has taught me that , in politics , modest ambitions are never the key to success !
I shall not keep saying that I am disappointed , because you need to hope in order to be disappointed .... and I have had no hope since the investiture debate .
And yet our President is a fine economist .
For this very reason , we cannot agree to cut pensions further .
There is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner .
What is more , the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control .
I would therefore ask the Commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens .
Europe ' s role : we first need to emphasise that Europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict : only then can we talk of the ' military ' role of the Union .
. ( FR ) The proposed action and programme presented by Mr Prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again .
In fact , the word seems to have been banished from the Commission ' s vocabulary , whereas liberal and American references abound .
The shift in meaning is not just semantic ...
Mr Prodi talks solely of ' mechanisms ' and ' structures ' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people .
. ( FR ) The European Union is flaunting its unbridled expansionist ambitions .
The Commission ' s objective for the next five years is to become a ' global actor ' by showing ' genuine leadership on the world stage ' .
The nature of the EU has not changed .
Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups .
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States , which it also sees as its future competitor and rival .
This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions , strengthening the power of the state , increasing competition , establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources .
We shall vote against these objectives , because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets .
We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons .
Firstly , the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission ' s programme .
In our opinion , the Commission ' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal .
This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments , on which the governments depend , will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction .
The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent , more transparent and more democratic .
We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council .
Corrie report ( A5-0032 / 2000 )
Madam President , the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions .
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them .
The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade , despite their vulnerable economies .
The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example .
The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section , namely agriculture , had not been finalised .
As Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments , one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents .
It is most worrying , especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape .
Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur ' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget .
We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State , which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature .
Alas , there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF .
Madam President , I welcome Mr Corrie ' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year .
The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention , which expires at the end of this month .
The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years .
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries .
Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste .
Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects .
The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity .
I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member .
. The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998 , there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection .
Over 95 % of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world .
While only around 10 % of the world ' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa , 70 % of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there .
80 % of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region .
The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one .
The effects of the AIDS pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub-Saharan region is being neutralised or reversed .
From the data which I am referring to today , it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide-ranging impact .
It is clear that the spread of AIDS in the sub-Saharan African Continent is linked to poverty .
AIDS treatments that may cost $ 18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $ 5 per capita .
It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner .
We must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the AIDS disease are fully met .
These countries include Ethiopia , Lesotho , Mozambique , Tanzania , Uganda and Zambia .
Prevention education should begin early in the primary school curriculum in these countries .
Appropriate messages about the health effects of AIDS must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate .
Health facilities and staff of NGOs need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients .
It is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective .
At a more central level , there is a need for more effective co-ordination between government donors , international NGOs , indigenous NGOs and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted .
Already weak economies are being further weakened in Africa by the AIDS virus .
Already stretched resources are being further stretched .
50 % or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an AIDS related disease in the countries where AIDS figures are highest .
I know that this is somewhat controversial , particularly , because of the attitude of the United States Government towards the Castro regime .
However , on this occasion , the European Union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the Lomé Convention Accord .
After years of ' good and loyal service ' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries .
It is the humane face of Europe ...
And the merit of Mr Corrie ' s report is that it highlights the value of this original , proactive development instrument , together with the work carried out by the Joint Assembly .
Especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened .
The partnership between the European Union and the ACP was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium .
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties , opening new prospects for this partnership .
It should seal their revival .
It brilliantly illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north-south relations .
At a time when the Joint Assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the ACP , this dimension must not only be preserved ; above all , it must be encouraged .
The Joint Assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of Europe and the developing countries defend their common interests .
After the debacle in Seattle , our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty .
The partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised .
. ( FR ) A few days after the demonstrations in Seattle , the ministers of the European Union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the WTO on the ACP , i.e. their former colonies .
The European Union prefers to send its funds to Eastern Europe , the former USSR and Asia , where there is greater opportunity for profit .
Or on Shell ?
We do not accept this agreement , which deprives people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the European multinationals and banks .
.
Few of my constituents will probably be aware that the EU is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world .
While others may have the biggest rockets , the EU has the deepest pockets .
This is something that the EU can rightly be proud of , and I think we should shout it from the rooftops more often .
The Labour Government ' s record in Britain is also a proud one .
Clare Short , MP , is one of the few Cabinet-level Ministers for international development in the world and , as such , can take her case to the very heart of government .
Gordon Brown , MP , meanwhile , has led international efforts to relieve crippling levels of Third World debt and ensured that Labour ' s campaign to reduce poverty does not end at the English Channel .
Whether through the minimum wage in Manchester or debt relief in Durban , Labour ' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same .
There is still much to be done , however .
The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle .
It must be a ' development round ' , in which developing countries , effectively excluded from previous rounds , are fully included .
For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves .
Developing countries want trade not aid , a help up not a hand-out .
And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products .
In this way , the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good , to benefit the poor not just the wealthy , the many not just the few .
Thus , whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown , Labour ' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same .
Swoboda report ( A5-0031 / 2000 )
In parallel , it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme .
However , the EU ' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary , inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature .
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach .
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans , which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness .
Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism , this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s .
In this sense , the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case .
Frassoni Report ( A5-0021 / 2000 )
Through the agreement , the European Parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under Article 251 of the Treaty .
We should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which , following the agreement , the European Parliament ' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it .
With the approval of this agreement , we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned .
However , it constitutes real progress in the right direction , which is something we do not wish to obstruct .

Company restructuring in Europe
The next item is the Commission statement - Company restructuring in Europe .
.
Mr President , industrial change , which can be gradual or sudden , is driven by new technologies , worldwide competition or consumer preferences .
It has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion , but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated , prepared for and managed .
The acceleration of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures .
Companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities .
Sometimes this calls for mergers of activities .
The Commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change .
We are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis .
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected .
On every occasion , and as recently as last October in this House , the Commission has highlighted the following basic positions .
Firstly , decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management .
Secondly , when dismissals prove to be inevitable , the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned .
This requires anticipation , timely preparation and careful management of these processes .
Thirdly , nothing can justify the absence of timely , effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers ' and employees ' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced .
Worker involvement is always , and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring , not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations .
In the end it is also a decisive factor of their success , as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust , dialogue , partnership and solidarity between its different components .
These basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in Europe .
This is what intelligent restructuring is about .
It is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns , as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past .
We have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the European Union .
I wish to recall that it is , in principle , up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules , if and when they are brought before them by national representatives .
However , even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management ' s attitude is socially irreprehensible .
In fact , the Commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today .
That is why in November 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support .
We thank you for that .
Unfortunately , the other branch of the legislative power , the Council , has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it .
I hope that this debate contributes to reminding Member States of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative .
We have recently heard from the Portuguese Presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched .
The forthcoming French Presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves .
As for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their European workforce .
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force .
The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this .
In any case , I wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them , notably through relevant national jurisdictional instances .
The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the European Works Council Directive .
As recognised in the report , which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks , we accept that the directive contains some loopholes .
Nevertheless , as my colleague , Commissioner Diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions , when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately , different considerations must be taken into account .
First , any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements , unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies .
Secondly , an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like European company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal .
The successful outcome of these other dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the EWC Directive and even provide some degree of a solution to the problems identified above .
Action is not limited to legislation .
To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change .
We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group , the Managing Change Report .
Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House .
Generally speaking , we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations , including their effects in terms of employment .
To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years .
The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds .
Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit .
Thank you very much Commissioner .
Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso , I understand you have a point of order .
If it is a personal statement , would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate , at which stage I would be happy to call you ?
Mr President , the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament , it is not a personal statement .
This morning , the President of Parliament , Mrs Nicole Fontaine , repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order .
Unfortunately , this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me .
In doing so , Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak .
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly .
I will willingly accept Madam President ' s apologies any time .
Thank you for your statement .
We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement .
I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote .
Therefore the House was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage .
But thank you for your remarks .
The subject in question is of great political and social importance .
Free enterprise , free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the European Union .
Company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments , and must therefore be defended .
However , all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles .
An American company - Goodyear - with production sites in Italy , Germany and England , is reviewing its production and relocation , justifiably , in its own view .
Just now , Commissioner Liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be uninformed .
Sadly , in this case , he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring .
I would also like to point out to Commissioner Liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court .
Commissioner Liikanen , we expect an authoritative intervention .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the second time within the space of four months , we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in Europe .
This is - as it was the first time round - sparked off by the reorganisation of large companies , which is linked to a drop in employment .
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies , in terms of both finance and management .
Our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed .
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million .
The company went under despite this .
This goes to show that jobs cannot be bought .
The market is a law unto itself .
As such , state aid costs the government twice : first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit .
Surely this cannot be the role of your , my and the citizens ' tax money ?
All this , of course , does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned .
My Group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution , for two reasons : firstly because this creates selective responsibility .
A company is pilloried one day and not the next .
Why should this be the case ?
Michelin caused a great stir .
But I did not hear a squeak when Nissan and IBM were discussed , where , similarly , a great number of European employees were involved .
Secondly , this is not fair towards employees of other companies where reorganisations also take place and where it hurts too .
My Group has signed a joint resolution with EPP and UEN , in which , however , we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names .
This is why the Liberal Group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9 .
If these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted , my Group will abstain from the final vote .
I do hope that this will not be necessary .
Mr President , the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required .
The first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs .
Yet the current situation in Europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed , particularly , and most seriously , by companies which are making huge profits .
In the past , workers were asked to show their solidarity with companies in order to ensure their survival . Now the companies are making huge profits but are also making workers redundant .
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy .
Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights .
This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant .
Commissioner , if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment , they must take clear steps to secure this .
Mr President , sadly , once again , Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe .
Yet again , workers are likely to lose their jobs .
This time , I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina .
As has already been pointed out , in one month ' s time , 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income .
Mr President , Commissioner , as far as restructuring goes , there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under .
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management .
The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers , be they by Michelin or Goodyear , are symptomatic in this respect .
Rationalised management and improved profits should , in my view , serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost , and any financial benefits should follow .
There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet , with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital .
Surely Europe should act as a safeguard , maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare ?
We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results .
Finally , allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for ' difference ' .
Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs . Without doubt , the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring .
I , like all Members present , am saddened by this loss of jobs .
Equally , I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution .
But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company ' s decision .
This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes , in this institution , forget that Europe cannot survive alone .
We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent .
In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective , adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted .
Two days later , Toyota , which employs several thousand people in my region , stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant .
We MEPs speak often about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way of creating them .
Take a large successful business , add European regulations , and within months you have created a small one .
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here .
Mr President , I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today .
In this respect , I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel ' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail .
But maybe next time , we ought to discuss CORUS , the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel .
I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields .
I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission ' s policy from these different vantage points , unlike my predecessor , who holds the belief that there is no need for rules .
We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now .
At present , we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition .
As such , I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments .
I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe , as company policy forms part of this .
The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty .
The European Union , in all of its aspects , must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes .
Mr President , earlier this week President Prodi announced that one of the Commission ' s strategic objectives for the next five years would be to aim for full employment .
He acknowledged that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion .
What is more , the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority .
Yet , all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies .
The Commission ' s decision to allow the ABB-Alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point .
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings .
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs .
The company ' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying .
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee .
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation , adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States .
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter .
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer .
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences .
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues .
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation .
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty .
I have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken later this evening .
The sitting was suspended at 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.05 p.m.
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido ( Spain )
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0159 / 2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido ( Spain ) ;
B5-0162 / 2000 by Mrs Díez González and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido ( Spain ) ;
B5-0169 / 2000 by Mr Puerta and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido ( Spain ) ;
B5-0175 / 2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido ( Spain ) .
Mr President , Commissioner , whenever a serious social problem occurs , it always has a political basis .
This is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in El Ejido .
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions .
We all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers .
We all , I believe , agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions .
These events certainly have their origin in , among other factors , the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully .
We hope that the events in El Ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated .
Yet it is not enough to regret the situation .
We do not want Africa to become our cross , in fact quite the contrary .
We must therefore act .
I should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another European region affected by immigration - the Canary Islands .
Firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for minors .
Secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration .
Thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect .
Finally we are producing a census of immigrants .
Mr President , last week , in the Andalusian town of El Ejido , we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the European Union in the year 2000 .
This was acknowledged by the Commission President , Romano Prodi , on 9 February when he confirmed that what had occurred in El Ejido went against the very principles of the European Union .
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism , xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated .
It is incomprehensible that ways of coexisting and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial .
We are all immigrants .
For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated .
Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes .
We are all immigrants , if not ourselves personally , then through one of our relations or ancestors .
However , instead of producing these events which we are condemning , migration must generate social , cultural and economic enrichment .
Secondly , all the authorities must act immediately . Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism .
These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these , as has happened with the mayor in question .
Mr President , initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon .
However , the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention .
This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider ' s .
In this respect we must not forget that the original victim ' s attacker was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated .
The current difficulties must also be taken into account so that this town can adopt the necessary measures , as indicated previously .
Mr President , Commissioner , Andalusia is one of the most tolerant and multiracial regions of the European Union .
Anyone , whether European or not , who lives and works in Andalusia , is an Andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect .
The EU can and must speak out . For you , the south is Andalusia but for us Andalusians it is Africa .
Mr President , Commissioner , I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years .
I was therefore aware how the situation was developing .
In El Ejido there is a serious social problem , problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the detonator .
These events have also acted as a wake-up call to our consciences .
Those responsible for what happened in El Ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants . We must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution .
Mr President , this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in Spain fighting for human rights .
All the Spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support .
It was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities ; the democratic system in Spain has been held up to ridicule , despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years .
Employers would be lost without immigrants .
Working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no Spaniard will accept them .
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today .
For four days , the immigrants were collectively hounded .
Women and children were beaten .
Fleeing from all quarters , hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a hill on the outskirts of the town .
We are right to blacklist Haider ' s Austria ; but we cannot allow little local Haiders to practice policies of racial exclusion and merciless economic domination .
What happened in Spain could happen in any country in the Union if we are not careful .
We all have a duty to put our own house in order .
It would be to our credit were the European Parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in Spain and throughout the Union are respected .
Mr President , acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of Europe .
Everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements .
We must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature .
No European society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other .
Without wishing to lump everything together hysterically , because each period is different , we have failed to learn the lessons of history .
That is my conclusion today .
Because this witch hunt which broke out in the province of Almería should have been foreseen .
We also know that many of them only earn EUR 30 a month , while their fellow European citizens can earn three times that .
This precarious wage-earning position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable .
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion .
We need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come .
It just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on Saturday .
We must take to the streets of Europe to protest against these alliances with extremists which are a disgrace to Europe and which lead our youth astray .
Mr President , since the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the European Union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia .
Two types of measure are required for this purpose . The first should seek the integration of people of non-European origin and the other should aim to organise immigration .
A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens ' .
This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities , labour exploitation and indecent living conditions , which have been condemned in the past .
I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration .
Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments . Outside the Community arena , some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies .
This is occurring in my country , despite the government , the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens .
The objective of combating racism and xenophobia , explained in the Treaties , should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians .
On 28 February 1998 the European political parties , including the Spanish Popular Party , signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society .
This requires coherent behaviour , yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out .
The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should , according to the commitments signed in this Charter , act forcefully .
It is only , as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar , through unity , responsibility and firmness that El Ejido , Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed .
Mr President , one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching , no less , of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido .
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame .
We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough , they have to suffer this type of aggression .
And if the aggressors include working-class people , all we can say to them is that , in acting in this way , they are digging their own graves .
In waging war against people who are as poor as they are , they are only doing their own exploiters a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves .
The lynch mob and their extreme right-wing mentors are the mortal enemies not only of the workers , but of society as a whole .
. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate .
I want to make it clear at the outset that the Commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at El Ejido against the immigrant workers of the region .
We express our support for the families and friends of the victims .
President Prodi and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements .
Naturally I completely endorse what they have said .
It was especially moving to hear the remarks from Members of Parliament who come from the region about what has happened , uncharacteristically , in a part of Spain that I know reasonably well .
Racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our Community , wherever they take place .
They fly in the face of the very principles on which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the European Union was founded : principles of liberty , democracy and respect for human rights .
The European Union has already laid the basis for Community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race .
This proposal is under examination by the Council and the European Parliament .
The Commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete .
The European Council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration .
Its objective here is to secure the rights of victims of criminal networks organising illegal immigration , with particular reference to the rights of women and children .
Those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour .
The word that is used about them in Chinese society is ' snake-heads ' .
It seems to me a fitting description of them .
Let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a European Union charter on fundamental rights , which has now reached the drafting stage .
Those rights are , by definition , universal .
The charter will extend to third country nationals in Member States even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of Member States of the Union .
The El Ejido incidents were shocking , as several Members have said in their speeches .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6 p.m.
Human rights
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Violence between ethnic groups in Mitrovica and Albanian prisoners in Serbia , notably the plight of Mrs Flora Brovina
B5-0140 / 2000 by Mr Dupuis and others , on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members - mixed group , on the situation in Kosovo ;

Mr President , before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica , I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me .
Indeed , it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here .
We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot , as nothing is actually done with them .
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends . I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present , given his powers .
But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate .
We need to cooperate with the Council too .
I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but , for the rest , nothing will get done .
I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate , so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council .
I think we should give this some thought .
I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament .
Thank you , Mr Staes .
We note your concern and will pass this on through the appropriate channels .
Violence between ethnic groups in Mitrovica and Albanian prisoners in Serbia , notably the plight of Mrs Flora Brovina
Mr President , Commissioner , we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons .
First , because Mr Sakellariou , who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote , vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender .
I have no doubt , and I am sure that you have no doubt , that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance .
The other reason is that this text does not , unfortunately , go very far .
I think that it manages , through a series of clever devices , to carefully avoid addressing the central issue , i.e. the final status of Kosovo .
I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia .
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo .
Finally , I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo .
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution , which you no doubt overlooked .
You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops .
I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange .
Why not ?
Mr President , what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible .
Violence begets violence , and revenge begets revenge .
The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on .
The Chief Commissioner of Police , Svend Frederiksen , has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed .
He has fewer than 2 000 officers , and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000 .
The police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence , so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities .
It should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them . Otherwise , there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands .
It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained , and the idea was , in fact , that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained .
However , there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime .
A year ago , we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up .
I was in Kosovo on 27 October 1998 when the Serbs withdrew .
The agreement was that 1 800 OSCE observers should arrive to guarantee the peace .
After a month , however , there was still only a handful of observers .
By Christmas , there were perhaps 100 and , by the spring , still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was , in fact , in place .
Atrocities were not even being recorded .
Then the war came , and the observers were withdrawn .
I would therefore ask the Commissioner : can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe ?
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers , who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad ?
I might also ask : when do you anticipate that they will be in place ?
And when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities ?
I mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all .
But NATO ' s decision for military intervention and the KLA ' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced Kosovo to a colony , as well as destroying civil infrastructures in Serbia .
In this sense , I am in agreement with Mr Sakellariou ' s proposals .
Flora defended herself , and asked Serbs and Albanians to shake hands .
Flora Brovina ' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade .
This is a sign of hope , the hope that it possible to act differently even in Serbia .
I believe that the European Union must do likewise .
The embargo on Serbia must be lifted and Serbia must , in turn , release its political prisoners .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to fully endorse Mrs Pack ' s very emotionally-charged contribution .
What she has said here is completely justified .
There is not one truth in Kosovo , there are several .
I refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is bending the truth .
I completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us .
We condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do , but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse .
Needless to say , the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why .
There are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the Trepca mines also plays its part .
We have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners .
There is a great deal of pain , a lot of suffering in Kosovo .
The people are holding demonstrations , they are sending us e-mails .
They ask us where their children are , their sons .
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer .
The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many .
We are right to include this in the draft resolution , but there are hundreds , even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there .
I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners .
The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo .
This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo , Mr Bernard Kouchner .
In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo , he needs , by his own reckoning , at least 6 000 foreign police officers .
The UN , however , have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800 .
To date , however , Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal . Moreover , half of this group is from the United States and Germany .
It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation , especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region .
What is disconcerting , however , is Mr Kouchner ' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days .
Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen , not more than 37 , in the crisis region .
For this hardly honourable position , Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs , Mr Chevènement .
According to Mr Kouchner , the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds .
I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome .
Press freedom in Angola
Mr President , I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity .
On the question of Angola , I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last .
It would be the first in a long time .
So I welcome it as such .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union .
Clearly , governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial , geostrategic or economic interests .
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy .
There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion .
Mr President , how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola ?
Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time , not only by UNITA , but also by the government itself .
The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle .
The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights .
Additionally , European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists .
Europe , as a major donor , has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola .
If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate , measures will need to be taken .
Without national reconciliation , reconciliation with Europe is not possible .
This being the case , Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House .
However , this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them .
Yet this is not the situation .
Angola does not enjoy rule of law . It is a repressive dictatorship .
It is at war , and a bloody war at that , which is dragging on and on .
The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept .
The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and , for example , by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki , for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House .
As another Member said , we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country .
For example , I have today received information directly from Rafael Marques , whose situation we are discussing , according to which two correspondents from Portuguese television have been imprisoned in Angola .
These cases keep occurring .
Yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in Angola .
The silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption , violence and war .
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa .
The first is the MPLA , which controls the oil profits . The second is the armed band of Mr Savimbi , which controls the diamond profits .
This war must be stopped .
The authority of this House could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the Angolan situation and also on the whole of southern Africa .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom .
This situation , as in neighbouring former Zaire , is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom .
This was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the First World War of Africa , given the involvement of certain countries in others .
This is a major issue because the Angolan State and authorities must assume their responsibilities . The international community and the European Union must spell this out very clearly .
These journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime , for which they are being persecuted .
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola .
We have experienced this in our own national and European history . People can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant .
The cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace , although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible .
Like a previous speaker , I also fully support the appeals which have been made .
We must , some time soon , find the courage to tackle the whole Angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously .
The people of Angola deserve better .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it seems as if the world is turned upside down .
Journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth , whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening .
This is Angola ' s reality .
We are now expressing our horror concerning this war .
Three million victims , two million driven from their homes within the country ' s borders , hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders , including women and children .
This is a war which transcends its borders . It is not just UNITA which is to blame .
The government too is responsible for this continuing violence . This is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds .
We would , at the same time , like to insist on other things .
We want the UN embargo , which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being flown across to UNITA airports , to stop .
But what do these sanctions mean ?
It is the western world itself which is partly to blame .
It is we , our own people , who keep the war going over there .
The so-called civilised world should hang its head in shame .
Mr President , we are partly to blame for this war .
We should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war .
Mr President , the facts are well-known .
On 24 December , the Angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the Portuguese paper , Expresso , to a year ' s imprisonment and a fine of USD 20 000 .
The journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the President ' s cabinet .
The trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness .
Another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the MPLA government party .
These are only two examples of a trend in Angola to silence any government critics .
Over the past year , more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security .
Their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along , namely the large-scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars , paid by the oil companies to the Angolan Government .
Even the British Minister , Peter Hain , conceded this recently .
We should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government , he told President Dos Santos last month .
But , at the same time , we note that Great Britain and also Portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government .
There is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding Angola .
On the basis of a report , the human rights organisation Global Witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of Dos Santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts .
I would like to challenge Portugal to deliver proof to the contrary , by making commercial interests subservient to human rights , to which so much lip service is being paid .
In my opinion , Angola is a test case .
We should , at any rate , judge the Portuguese Presidency on its actions and not on its words .
Native Americans in the US - Dineh
This is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time .
It is up to the European Parliament to protect vulnerable people .
So we need to do this .
This is also about respecting a culture , a language , a way of life and a people ' s religion , a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared .
It is important to point this out .
We have just approved the water directive here in Parliament .
The forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally .
People should no longer be forced to move .
Over the past 25 years , no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop .
If people need to move at all , they need to be given a viable alternative .
This is not the case here .
The area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable .
This is why I think that we as European Parliament need to ask the American authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and , if necessary , abandon the scheme altogether .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is my maiden speech and I am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights .
We need to continue to stand up for these rights , especially in our own Member States and societies , but also elsewhere .
As Mr Sterckx said , we certainly need to do this vis-à-vis the United States which , after all , is close to us in terms of democratic values .
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights .
The account of the Dineh Indians is telling .
The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history .
It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land .
The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and , thanks to the efforts of the Belgian ' Mother Earth ' organisation , we are being kept informed of this situation .
This too is characteristic of American society , which hears little about it .
They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents , but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country .
Today , the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land , for their right to dignity and , above all , for their right to their way of life .
There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful , economic adversary .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers , but I would like to emphasise a few things .
The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians .
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years .
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years .
The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries .
The Relocation Act , which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation , authorised the relocation of the peoples .
This relocation is , of course , unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic , social and cultural terms .
The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry .
Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives .
The population was not allowed any input .
This resembles a kind of trade in human beings .
The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium .
It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians .
This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution : we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial , religious and industrial groups .
So let us contact the United States now !
Mr President , in terms of human rights , there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya .
We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny .
Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters .
We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated .
Despite the pledges made , violations in , for example , Alfanyurt have still not been investigated .
The fate of Andrey Babitsky , the correspondent in Grozny of Radio Liberty , who was arrested by Russian troops , is a dramatic example of Russian policy .
It contravenes Article 3 of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press .
We want information from the Russian authorities as to Mr Babitsky ' s whereabouts and his state of health .
Mr President , a journalist is on a fact-finding mission and this calls for freedom .
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war .
The war in Chechnya , like any war , is a trail of horrors .
The filtration camps are camps in which torture , rape and violations are perpetrated : we know that now .
And just what is Mr CFSP doing ?
What are we doing about it ?
I beg you to intervene .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the tragic case of the courageous Russian journalist Andrey Babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which Russia has sunk .
The entire Federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda .
A warlord has become President and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters .
Journalists , on the other hand , who are simply going about their work in Russia , i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible , are being treated like criminals .
The Russian Government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes .
I can only reiterate my appeal to the Council and the Commission to stick to the rules .
It is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the EU if it does not recognise democratic principles .
Mr President , what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as ' terrorists ' and ' bandits ' ?
Without any hesitation , the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs , Vladimir Rushailo , earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question .
The victim of this exchange is said to be the 35-year-old war correspondent of Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty , Andrey Babitsky .
I am using the phrase ' is said to be ' on purpose , because official Chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged Mr Babitsky for a number of Russian prisoners of war .
In the meantime , the highest Russian authorities are casting a veil of secrecy over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist .
For example , Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country ' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely .
Russia ' s new strong man , however , added a rather puzzling comment to this welcome declaration : ' As far as I am aware , Mr Babitsky already feels free . '
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising .
The facts are clear .
Andrey Babitsky was an unwanted busybody in Mr Putin ' s ' anti-terrorist ' operation in Chechnya .
Hence his disappearance of over one month .
In any case , the Babitsky affair warrants one conclusion : the leaders in Moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage-taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically Chechen crime .
This resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the Chechen tragedy .
Nor is it a mere luxury . Indeed , it is in line with some thirty Russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on Andrey Babitsky free of charge .
Cambodia
I do not think that reconciliation is possible after such murderous tragedies , unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced .
Nor do I think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial .
I became convinced of this in Sarajevo when I had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement , none of which unfortunately lasted , between the parties to the conflict .
Every time , just as the exchange was about to take place , we found men missing from the meticulously drawn up lists .
Every time , when we asked why , the reply was the same , ' We cannot release him : he is a war criminal ' .
In the emotion , pain and fury of the agreements , it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance .
I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations .
This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace .
Mr President , it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister .
These papers actively support the opposition politician , Mr Sam Rengie .
Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason .
In his millennium speech , he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death .
In March of last year , a member of Sam Rengie ' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal .
In September , two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister .
This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm .
In October , a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid .
The pattern of intimidation is clear .
Even more serious is the government ' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal .
It is true , the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased .
Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case , Kosovo and , in milder form in our own Union , the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria .
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice .
At the same time , the struggle against impunity is under threat .
The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow .
.
Mr President , we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday .
First of all , on Kosovo , the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo , as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails .
Our efforts in Kosovo , as elsewhere in the wider region , are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation .
In particular we support the development of a free , democratic and multi-ethnic society .
Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and , in particular , to try to build confidence between the various communities .
We have always condemned ethnic violence , no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim .
We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past .
We support the efforts of UNMIK , KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order .
In this regard we strongly support the High Representative ' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo .
It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate .
I hope it will underline the importance , when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy , of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects .
It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity .
We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons .
I totally agree with the points put so passionately by the Mrs Pack , either before trial or following judgement .
The plight of Kosovar Albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing .
We call on everyone , within and outside Kosovo , to support these common aims , to support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to achieve them .
Turning briefly to Angola , we had again a number of knowledgeable speeches , especially from Mr Soares , with his unrivalled knowledge of the subject .
The Commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in Angola .
It is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society .
An area of special concern is the harassment of journalists , including temporary detention of members of the so-called independent press .
The European Union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the Angolan Ministry of Justice in November last year .
We fully support the work of the UN through UNUA , given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in Angola .
We are also committed to the Security Council ' s sanctions against UNITA , including arms controls .
While maintaining emphasis on humanitarian needs , the Commission is preparing for a post-conflict phase in our financial support for Angola .
An essential element will be support for democracy and human rights , including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society .
The European Union has condemned the use of anti-personnel landmines and we are supporting de-mining operations through an international NGO .
This is a subject which is not given sufficient attention .
On the question of the indigenous peoples in the US , I am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the US authorities will have been noted by them .
The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist , Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally .
This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya , and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before .
There are alarming reports of human rights violations .
Of course , there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict .
The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month .
We await a proper response from the Russians .
In the meantime , the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today .
And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March , if we need to do so .
Finally , on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge : we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes .
I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon .
We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year .
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders .
At the same time , we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties .
I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan , Secretary-General of the UN , on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal .
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law , democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year .
It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days .
I hope we have other opportunities , but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead .
Thank you very much Commissioner Patten .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m.

on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos , Somes , Tisza and Danube Rivers .
Mr President , we debated the framework directive on water this week , and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water .
This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union .
We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström ' s brief visit , for it can contribute to this awareness .
After all , this is a candidate country we are talking about , and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time .
The polluter ought to pay .
I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called ' Wild East ' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place .
I would be in favour of its doing so .
Mr President , Commissioner , there has been one ecological disaster after another and , unfortunately , they are all similar .
Once again , there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe .
The delta of the Danube is in danger .
As in Spain in April 1998 , as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December , once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat .
The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger , which threatens our environment , upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations .
This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries .
The authorities in these counties , which are still very frail from an environmental point of view , need to overcome numerous obstacles .
But , over and above that , it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question .
I hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility .
The environment must be a priority area within the reunification of the European continent .
It must form the basis for our partners ' political will .
Implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop , it will also have social and economic benefits and , at the same time , public health standards will improve .
The efforts already being made need to be stepped up .
The European continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the ' polluter pays ' principle .
Mr President , when the Doñana disaster occurred , the non-governmental organisation , the World Wide Fund for Nature , gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in Europe .
The number is huge . They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply , ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas .
I visited Doñana after the spill and saw how agriculture , fishing and the lives of people in the surrounding area were enormously compromised .
I therefore believe that the European Union must , to start with , carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in Europe .
We must bring these reservoirs under Community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again .
If we do not , we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent .
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today .
Is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals ?
The answer , of course , is an emphatic no .
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide .
I assume , therefore , that the EU will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total , worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance .
It has already been banned in most EU countries for a long time now .
That an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs .
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment , Margot Wallström , has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself , on the spot , what has happened .
It also sheds light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant States .
We must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people ' s health and the ecosystems .
For example , the overflow from the decanting basins at the gold mines in Salsigne , in France , have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today .
We know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions .
Who is going to pay ?
Which is why the environmental aspect , which is becoming a matter of urgency , must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs .
I am thinking in particular of the gold mines in French Guiana , where the workers , who are generally women , are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions .
. Let me associate myself , not least as a former Environment Minister , completely and without any reservation whatsoever , with the expressions of concern by honourable Members .
An objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage .
But early reports suggest that the poisoning of the Lepos , Tisza , Somes and Danube Rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy .
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days .
No living organisms , from microbes to otters , have been spared .
Several Members have set out what seems to have happened .
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens .
Some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster , at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned , on a par with Chernobyl .
It has affected the peoples of three countries - Romania , Hungary and Yugoslavia .
It is the Tisza , Hungary ' s second river , perhaps its most beautiful and most loved by its people , that has borne the brunt .
As with all such disasters it is the long-term consequences that are the most pernicious .
Some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to restock the river .
There is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish .
We plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can , as rapidly as we can , to help cope with this catastrophe .
That is certainly the view of my colleague , Commissioner Wallström , who I know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today .
We stand ready to do so .
We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently .
The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA , in Geneva , for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts .
We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed . That is obviously crucial .
It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it .
It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged .
There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities .
This is an important point , as several speakers have suggested .
The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy .
It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case .
The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due .
The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin .
We will want , in the longer term , to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster , above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place .
The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection , along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today .
But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis .
As I have said , my colleague , Commissioner Wallström , is on the spot today .
She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit .
This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
VOTE
However , the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and exacerbating unemployment .
Moreover , it is all just words , because the Socialist governments , which are now in a majority in Europe , are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments .
The real problem is not finding a legal way of slightly complicating redundancy procedures , but banning them .
Society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners . The first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment .
The sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone , without cutting wages , must be taken from the profits of large companies .
It is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders .
Tourism and employment
, rapporteur .
The importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data .
It would be appropriate , therefore , to begin by summarising the impact of tourism on the lives of Union citizens and the desirability , in both economic and social terms , of promoting the European tourist industry .
Firstly , I would remind you that the tourist industry is one of the infrastructures which any advanced society must have .
Without it , institutions , business and the world of work could not function .
Tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their habitual place of residence and thus confers mobility , the characteristic feature of contemporary society .
The term ' tourism ' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun , sea and holidays , which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level .
Clearly , the importance of tourism for the economy of regions traditionally regarded as tourist destinations , southern regions for example , is very different , and should be studied carefully .
Social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists , thus creating an entire productive system .
In such cases , there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers , thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy .
In Europe today , the tourism market contributes 5.5 % of the gross national product and occupies a rather significant proportion of the workforce , approximately 6 % .
Those figures are incomparably higher for some countries .
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe , tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union ' s regions .
Another factor is that the world market is growing explosively .
The forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010 , but unfortunately for Europe there is a reverse trend .
Europe ' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of Asia , the Far East and America .
You see , the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport , its reduced cost , and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe .
Here , then , I want to point out that international competition is tough and , if we are to overcome it positively , we must together envision and share a long-term strategy .
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism , so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age .
The new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally undervalued , non tourist areas , which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments .
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff , including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work .
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development .
The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions : what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this ?
There is a shortage of facts : we have no information on the economic impact , which still remains a complete mystery .
We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other , despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament .
With the aim of working out a strategy , it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible , so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs .
This does not follow automatically : often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry , without this being matched by an increase in employment .
There is no legal basis , and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector .
A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies , to coordinate and to programme , all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets .
First and foremost , we need to compete in terms of quality .
Finally , we consider that tourism can , in addition to being a growth factor , be a factor for democracy , and in this regard we are asking the Commission for a clear , conscious commitment .
Mr President , there are three points I wish to address .
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty .
This is something I favour , but currently as part of a minority in my own Group .
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism , both to local economies and as a factor of European integration .
The problem for some of us , however , is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity .
Second , there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism .
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism .
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks .
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable .
Third , there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment .
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment .
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment .
Students are an obvious example .
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection .
Thus , while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend , we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed .
Mr President , during the most recent meeting of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I was pleasantly surprised .
The opinion of Mr Sánchez García , addressed to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , contained a remark regarding the IGC .
The draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the Treaty .
This was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
Having heard many Members who share the view expressed in the opinion , this was a real relief .
Unfortunately , his text has not survived the vote .
It does , however , support my view that I am not , apparently , the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion .
This brings me to the content of the report .
An important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment .
Especially in the southern Member States , the tourist industry is a major source of income .
From this vantage point , there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy .
The seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention .
I am surprised , however , at the fact that many want to achieve this by means of Community policy .
This is not desirable , either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment .
The discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors .
Within these regions , a huge range of problems have their part to play .
It is obvious that mainly local and regional - and , therefore , to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy .
For this reason , I cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to European level .
In addition , employment policy in general is also a factor .
Here too , the structure of the economy differs for each Member State , and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse .
It will not do for one type of policy , probably with many exceptions and adaptations , to be applied .
This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily .
It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves .
Their expertise , is , of course , superior to that of the Commission .
This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment . Even in the tourism industry .
It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers .
Mr President , you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands .
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report .
It is a very extensive report .
We greatly welcome it , just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on , the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission .
I hope that the Commission will not forget that .
Having set it up , I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust .
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation .
As has already been said in this debate , three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for .
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position .
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism ' s contribution to job creation .
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating , innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development .
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology .
He has convinced me of that .
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together .
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed , therefore , for integrating job creation strategies .
Let us look at some of these reasons .
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one .
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry , particularly the more vulnerable groups , such as young people , women and the unskilled .
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first .
The availability of unskilled , temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community .
Tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage .
If we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in Europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across Europe .
We are losing market share .
I believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive .
I hope you will help us .
And of course , tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment , especially among society ' s more sensitive sections : women and young people .
In view of all this , I think it is a serious contradiction that there is no European policy on tourism .
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector .
The occasional application of Article 308 - formerly Article 235 - which requires unanimity , has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only EUR 8 million for five years and 15 Member States .
With sorrow , I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission ' s services , tourism is dealt with by a section , not even a directorate , within the Directorate-General for ' Enterprise ' .
But we must support our tourism !
Clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level .
Since then , however , there has been no progress .
There must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of Europe ' s tourism and , to the extent of the possible , safeguard the operation of companies .
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure , so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by thanking Mr Viceconte for his report , which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated .
Tourism is a social , economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens , either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services .
Every year , nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel , usually to other countries in Europe .
Moreover , Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries , even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products .
Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious , thereby hampering its sustainable development .
It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible .
Let us not forget that , in the most remote regions , tourism is the most important industry in terms of income .
The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community .
In addition , tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement , insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop .
Mr President , we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance .
The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment .
Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old .
I believe this is the first debate in this House with the new Commission and a new Commissioner , Mr Liikanen , who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing .
I would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly .
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment . What expectations does the Commissioner have that the new Intergovernmental Conference which is starting will include this aspect ?
This very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed . We now hope to be able to solve these problems .
Tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the European Union .
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all , including the United States of America , which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans .
I would like to stress one point in the Viceconte report which I welcome and particularly support , and which I would like the House and the Commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response .
It regards tourism for senior citizens .
I usually see Commissioner Diamantopoulou desperately tearing her hair out , bit by bit , because the elderly live too long , leading to problems with pension payments .
Tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen States and of the entire world closer together , and of course , it leads to peace and understanding .
This kind of tourism , which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens , is just as important .
Senior citizens are always on holiday , all year round , from 1 January through to 31 December because they do not work and do not have just one month off during the year .
Unfortunately , this is not true of them all , but this is why I am calling on the Commission to follow up on the Viceconte report .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 7.40 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
This declaration - which , as I have said , implicates the European Parliament , although no such declaration was put before this Parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation .
I thank the President , Mrs Fontaine , who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House .
I would like these words to be heard , because the European Parliament cannot be implicated in this way in a crazy declaration which I consider to be totally unacceptable .
Thank you , Mr Nogueira , for your explanation .
I would remind you that questions on the Minutes should refer to the Minutes .
In any event , for those Members who not aware of the President ' s position , I will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today ' s Minutes :
" On 17 February , Mrs Nicole Fontaine , President of the European Parliament , received as guests , at their request , the representatives of the Forum d ' Ermua .
The Spanish Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were represented .
Following this interview , the representatives of this Forum presented her with a text entitled " Strasbourg Declaration " . The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this " declaration " .
Strasbourg , 17 February " .
I therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up .
Mr President , I would like to request a correction to the Minutes regarding the vote on Amendment No 5 of the Swoboda report .
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond , Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment .
We take note and this will appear in the Minutes .
We should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings .
I have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform .
So I think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all .
Surely we should be more selective .
In any event , the Bureau will consider your suggestion .
( The Minutes were approved )
VOTE
We think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective .
Mr President , the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the European Union .
It is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the EU 's areas of competence .
A criticism which is often levelled at the EU and which , to some extent , is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas .
One such area is tourism which , by its very nature , is very much a national concern .
In so far as tourism falls within the political domain , it should be at national , regional and local level .
Tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the EU 's financial support for less well-off regions .
Even in that respect , any cooperation should , however , be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle .
Because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment , there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation .
However , such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy .
The report laments the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism .
However , the Swedish Christian Democrats would oppose any such development as we believe that tourism is a matter with which the European Union should only be marginally concerned .
. ( DA ) Tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market , which ought to be promoted and encouraged .
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe , as well as in the rest of the world , should have the opportunity to experience each other ' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies .
Policy on tourism is not , however , something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the European Parliament or by the EU as a whole .
I am therefore voting against the proposal .
Mr Tajani will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order , but I understand his political meaning .
We will proceed to the debate itself and Mr Monti will take the floor on behalf of the Commission .
European postal services
Mr President , the postal sector continues to be an area in which old , outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition .
And , in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission , the situation has gone on for far too long .
The EU ' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas , but not in the postal sector .
One of the EU ' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market .
We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States .
That requires greater efficiency which , in turn , is dependent on competition .
Today , one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation , an exercise in which the EU often leads the way , while the Commission 's determination to make progress serves as a model .
The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects .
It has been done in a number of different areas but , unfortunately , the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now .
It can hardly be because customers are satisfied .
We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes , and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion .
If we really want a functioning internal market , we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services .
A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services . The Netherlands , Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road .
During the 1990s , they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved .
Moreover , Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus .
The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement .
Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which , as customers , we are all entitled to expect .
Prior to this discussion , a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies .
They hold up Sweden as a warning , which might be appropriate in certain instances , but not as regards postal services .
It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993 .
However , for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market , prices have fallen .
That shows that competition really is working .
My conclusion is therefore : make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market , too .
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...
( The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov ) I thought I had the floor .
Perhaps we can discuss this later on .
However , I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said , namely , that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition , whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly .
That is usually the case .
That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector .
Mr Markov , in five or six minutes time , you will be allowed a few minutes to speak .
I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members .
Mr President , there is a mystery .
What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997 ?
There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now .
I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today .
I am very fond of him .
He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners .
It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues .
There has , over this period , been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive .
Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties .
That has only happened recently .
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this .
We really have not progressed very far .
However , since Commissioner Monti is here , I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about .
It was about gradual liberalisation ; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price ; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector .
These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive .
The postal service is not just for Christmas .
It is for life .
In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service .
It is about keeping communities together .
The postal service is also the bus service .
The postal service is also the social service .
The postal service is also the doctor .
If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade .
We will cut them off .
The postal services are important .
That message must be taken back from here today .
The Commission must listen to it .
Mr President , we are in favour of liberalising the Union ' s postal services .
This should first of all stand for better service .
This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal .
Liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly .
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer ' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly , because , for example , the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically ?
The question is , therefore : what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet ?
As you can see , as a new MEP , I am trying to get to grips with the dossier and I must admit that I have great difficulty doing so .
I think that the Commission could have been more pro-active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested .
As far as I know , that has still not happened .
I would therefore ask you , Commissioner , to help me in my task as a new Member .
Like Mr Miller , I would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or , if at all possible , within the next couple of days .
I would welcome more concrete information on this .
Apparently , the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so .
There are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the Post Office .
But in Belgium too , there are a great number of people , older people for example , who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman .
We should not overlook this fact : postal service is about more than just ferrying around letters and parcels .
The postal service is also extremely important to companies .
A study has shown that 90 % of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10 % between individuals .
What exactly do you intend to liberalise ?
I would like more information on this , because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services .
There are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job .
We need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things .
This concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today .
That is not the sort of postal service that we want .
The economic value of the postal service was recognised by the Treaty of Amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail .
The matter of the European Union ' s recognition of a high-quality postal service , available to all , remains valid today , and we are increasingly concerned .
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism come Monday .
Let us point out that Parliament ' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance supported them .
This resolution of 14 January 1999 required that , prior to undertaking any liberalisation of this key sector , involving 1.7 million employees after all , the Commission should provide impact studies for this liberalisation .
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing , I think we all still remember them .
We further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision , as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive .
Mr President , I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered .
But as an entrepreneur myself , I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of " privatisation " and " liberalisation " !
Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all , but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations .
Members should however represent all the citizens , which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy .
In practice that means the following for the postal services : firstly , priority must be given to employment .
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation , but the premises must be right .
Secondly , we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services .
Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk .
Mr Stenmarck , Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union .
So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent .
On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights , it is worth considering further price cuts ; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying .
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile .
In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today , to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament ' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset .
What has become of it ?
Do we have the results of this impact study ?
This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service .
So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation , and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation .
As you know , in our country , each village has its own local post office or at least a post box , with a collection every day .
If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way , more post offices will be closed , in the name of this infamous profitability , which is often the cause of rural regression .
Once again , Europe is distancing itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .
Everyone is free to choose their lifestyle . They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment .
In sport the saying goes , " Do not change a winning team . "
Why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory ?
The universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget .
We are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes , or even 50 grammes .
So be it . But the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies .
If revenue is lost , then public interest operations will be revised and cut , and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made .
Mr President , I am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at European level .
If people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have European regulations to govern it .
In Ireland some services are provided by companies from outside Ireland , for example , English companies certainly operate there .
But this directive has never been transposed into national law .
It is the job of the Commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under European law and transpose European directives .
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government .
A small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators .
This is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the Union .
I come from a rural area .
I support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and I recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years .
For example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the European Union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago .
I remember when people came into this House lobbying us in the national interest not to allow this liberalisation .
We allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education .
Our older people , even though on social welfare , can enjoy the benefits of travel .
So liberalisation has taken a lot of parasites off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living .
On the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided .
So , the Commission , in bringing forward their new proposals , must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services .
In rural areas , for many years , even before the Irish Free State came into existence , we sometimes had this service of a post office .
Today , it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that European legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it .
I want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service .
But complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in Ireland .
I want the Commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service .
It should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas .
We must implement what the directive insists on , that the postal service is available to everybody .
The postal services in Greece , Great Britain , the Netherlands or Belgium are , of course , all different .
How can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross-border mail which amounts to approximately 25 % , as opposed to less than 5 % in other countries ?
How are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office ' s business abroad ?
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject .
But what will those limits be ?
In any event , we ask the Commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals , having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the Member States .
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself , but only a means towards improving services .
But then again , the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment .
Past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an undesired effect .
I would remind you of the fact that the Belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know-how and expertise from disappearing from the company .
Once again , the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce .
Mr President , postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so , given their importance .
Only last week , in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners , Plaid Cymru , the party of Wales , made his maiden speech on that subject .
The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices , especially in rural areas , play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities .
Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services .
Post office outlets in Scotland , as we have heard , handle much more than just mail delivery .
Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents , local taxes and so on .
But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts , so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened .
If a rural post office closes , usually with the only local shop attached , then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result .
Mr President , the task of the post office is to ensure that , every day , the post is delivered everywhere , be it in the city or in remote , rural areas , at the same tariff .
For 150 years , the postal services have been a public affair and , as such , just like public transport and the power supply , a core task of the national governments .
Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote .
They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs .
I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village : " The postal service belongs to us all ; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft " .
The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors .
The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices .
They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees .
Such companies have always been around , but they used to be banned , whereas these days they are being heralded as progress .
The end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices .
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages .
It is time we stopped this trend .
A fault confessed is half redressed .
We are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , people used to be summoned to demonstrations by letter or telegram ; nowadays this is done by e-mail and via websites !
It is clear that electronic mail , electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future .
I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service .
We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market .
I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular , which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures .
Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage , because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe .
That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important .
The collection , sorting , transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension .
I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity .
As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests .
We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid .
That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services .
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector .
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice , fairness and solidarity .
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive .
We should define the universal service precisely , establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender .
I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system .
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people .
Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service , which decided , for instance , to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas .
Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors , European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical , untrammelled liberalisation .
The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs .
Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999 .
That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved .
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation , not just on the economic organisation of the market , but also in terms of its human and social aspects .
The delays in the Commission ' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question .
By defining a sector reserved for public postal services , on the basis of weight and price limits , the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases .
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services .
Mr President , I rise as other Scottish Members of this House , representatives of Scotland , to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts .
The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland .
It would be a disaster if action were deliberately , or even inadvertently , taken which had the effect of damaging that .
I do not believe that it is anybody ' s intention to do so .
I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece .
But they might accidentally do great damage .
The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place .
If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service , it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate .
The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability .
The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily .
The Commission should not , for example , take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to , as some have suggested , as low as 50 grammes .
On the contrary , it should proceed cautiously .
I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances .
The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else , at an affordable stamp price .
Stand by universality and affordability !
Mr President , the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service .
This service must therefore be kept public .
In our opinion , the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted , including its timetable .
I think ours is a different approach !
European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy , telecommunications and air transport - and the target , the focus , was always the consumer .
The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services .
I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs .
He does not need a government to do so , or a parliament , nor does he need a Commission to do so !
The postal market is limping along behind and , sadly , we have wasted valuable time here .
I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends .
I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig , who also talked about e-commerce .
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges ; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges .
I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market .
It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy .
We should seize that opportunity , for the citizen keeps asking , why do we have Europe ?
These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe .
I am glad Mr Monti , the Commissioner for competition , is here today in person , for he is pursuing an excellent policy .
We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy , and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible .
Yet I believe that , as this debate has shown , we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas .
So I would ask you to give an impetus in that direction , together with Parliament .
I believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits , the positive aspects of competition .
For competition is not an end in itself ; it is there to serve of the citizen , the consumer , which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it .
Mr President , liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public ; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology .
I emphasise the word ' could ' , and that is if it is done well and with care .
Wrongly done , the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality .
On the other hand , the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants , and the people that will not benefit from the new services .
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland , as testified by the present public system .
Mr President , a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service .
It would be obscene to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers , millions of service users , in a great rush .
But , despite the unfavourable opinion of ten European postal services , a form of unacknowledged privatisation is brewing in the corridors of the Commission .
By lowering the price / weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising mailshots or cross-border post , the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector .
Postal services may then keep whatever does not whet the appetite of the private operators .
Whether total or partial , privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse .
Just the example of the privatisation of British rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which opting for maximum profit is antipathetic to maintaining a socially useful service .
Mr President , today ' s debate comes under the sign of the snail , not because I ate such excellent snails here in Strasbourg yesterday but because the snail is a symbol of slow progress .
One example of this slow progress is the way the Commission is proceeding .
This study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last .
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now .
Today ' s debate makes it quite clear that Parliament wants more emphasis on speed , not speed at the expense of quality , but then slowness alone does not mean quality either .
This brings me to my second point , namely the snail as symbol of our postal services .
What has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from Munich to Brussels has increased fivefold .
Letters to Strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner , but it still takes far too long .
That means that since the days of mail-coaches and taxis , we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services .
So I believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what Mr Radwan described in such excellent terms , namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other , define the limits .
But what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite !
Some speakers have referred to the social importance of the postman . Let me add to that , the importance of the post offices .
They have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas .
I come from Munich , a very densely populated urban conglomeration , but we have the same problem there .
One urban district post office after another is being closed down .
We have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities , who are becoming increasingly lonely with the decline in the number of retail shops .
That is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people .
So , yes to liberalisation , but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation , rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission .
I would hope that in future the symbol of European postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be dispatched post-haste .
That is a term that harks back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed .
Like Mr Radwan , I am glad that Commissioner Monti is here rather than Commissioner Bolkestein because I believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition .
Competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 January 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates .
This has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations .
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union , what consequences would that have for free competition ?
For the moment , it appears that , in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - Sweden - there has been a 59 % increase in the price of postal services .
We do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place .
For example , there are currently companies which set up in Holland because the postal charges are lower than in Germany and the same may happen in the future .
In a service which is theoretically liberalised , free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies abusing their dominant position , agreements between companies and other similar circumstances .
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation , taking strict account of free competition , because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future .
My prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services .
Mr President , the postal service is not a normal service provider like a hairdresser ' s or a fitness centre .
For us in Finland , a sparsely populated country , a visit to the post office is a social event .
In the world of networking , the mail service is the most democratic of all networks .
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships .
The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers .
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure .
Commissioner Monti , the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships : postal services must be improved , not run down .
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone ' s reach in society .
The post office is democracy .
It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies .
Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50 % of companies ' turnover .
Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office .
I would suggest that there is a solution .
It is already employed widely in the transport sector .
Air routes , ferry routes , train routes , bus routes , within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender .
The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract .
Let us call this a negative tender franchise .
This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system .
Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner ?
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time .
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender ?
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate .
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services .
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States .
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road , sometimes served poorly by public transport , sometimes not at all .
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities , such as a school , a post office and a shop .
It is on the last two that the elderly , in particular , depend .
Often they are located together , each service being made more viable by the existence of the other .
Scotland also has many island communities , some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries .
It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London .
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged .
The more remote the community , the greater the difference becomes .
That is the measure of the problem .
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service .
.
Mr President , I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague , Commissioner Bolkestein , on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services .
I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein .
May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism of Parliament .
Some Members , like Mr Stenmarck , complain that there have been delays with the new proposal .
Others believe that it is not so bad after all , if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation .
This is , for example , the position expressed by Mr Berthu .
The Commission ' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission , of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware .
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made .
It is Commissioner Bolkestein ' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year .
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible .
The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service , to which I will come back in a second .
As regards the existing directive and its implementation , most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive .
A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence .
The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003 .
Further liberalisation will occur afterwards .
In some areas competition is already taking place , as in the parcels sector and in the express services .
The quality of services has , generally speaking , improved , in particular in regard to cross-border activity .
The quality of services , which is so relevant to consumers , was a main concern of all speakers , some of whom , like Mr Rübig , were very explicit on this point .
So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality .
Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes , as these standards will better reflect actual performance .
This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators , competitors and customers .
We can see in the incumbent operators , in public post offices , a change of culture that I believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers ' needs continues .
The concerns expressed in this Parliament this morning by honourable Members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the Commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal .
The issue of universal service was mentioned by Mrs Isler Béguin , by Mr Miller , whom I thank for his personal message , and by many others .
We believe that the universal service is a pillar and I am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee .
Mrs Gillig , but others like Mr Markov and Mr Ésclope , voiced concerns about employment .
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress , as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation .
The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment .
On the availability of the studies , - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999 .
They have all been available on the Commission ' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested .
The studies have been the object of some criticism , especially on the part of the public postal services .
I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data .
This was no surprise , since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection .
Does that not say a lot about management ability ?
No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties .
Nevertheless , Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process .
I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services , that is competition .
Mr Purvis , I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring .
This applies both to the post and other sectors .
We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made .
The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post ' s numerous recent acquisitions .
I will not go into the details due to lack of time , but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses .
In a sense this is where its work begins .
Finally , Mr Radwan , of course , there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition .
That concept I reject firmly , because competition is there for the citizens , and for them alone .
Most companies hate competition .
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens , their economic interest and for their liberty .
The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this .
I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday , in the appropriate committee , more competently and in much more detail .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Pursuant to Rule 42 ( 5 ) , I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
This does not mean that we approve the entire contents , which are too vague and which leave out the main concern .
Postal services must continue to be public services .
All people , regardless of their location or social status , must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions .
In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability , and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities .
Consequently , the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service .
The post office and , more generally , all public services must , on the other hand , recruit additional staff .
Such jobs are unquestionably useful , and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe .
Mr President , personally I voted in favour of this resolution , because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation .
If we dismantle the public service , this would be very serious , and we wish to know what are the Commission ' s intentions .
Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate .
People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so .
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service .
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day .
We can salute them , these postmen who , whatever the weather , sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone .
Dismantling the postal service , the local communication service , would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens .
Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion .
Mr President , I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives .
Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman , particularly in mountain communities .
I wholeheartedly agree . However , it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints .
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman .
I know that this service is unprofitable .
It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages .
If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee , particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service , then the public service must be protected .
I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service , even if our post offices operate like businesses .
They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email .
. ( FR ) Here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation .
If liberalisation continues in this area too , then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service .
I am a European and even a federalist .
To achieve this I was ready and I am ready to make certain sacrifices , but not just anything !
President .
Parliament has completed the agenda .

( The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 18 February 2000 .
Statement by the President
The same day , I conveyed my own and the European Parliament ' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims ' families .
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy .
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society .
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based .
Terrorism , whatever form it takes , is unacceptable .
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA , I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain .
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to observe one minute ' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament , spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government .
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography . ' We are in Europe .
In my grandparents ' time , it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville .
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane .
Today , at the end of the 20th century , a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency .
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country .
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically .
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and , what is more , desirable .
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation .
Everyone can be what they want to be because , if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union , there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British .
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function ? "
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question . Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European ?
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque , but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person .
What difference does it make to be Basque ? Surely it is all the same thing .
May he rest in peace .
( Loud applause )
In recent times , in this House , we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe .
It does not matter what banner these come under because , in the end , they are all different expressions of the same thing .
( Loud applause )
ETA must be condemned . However , those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned .
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road .
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties , whether they are national or nationalist , and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are .
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident .
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing .
It is time to share the Basque Country , Spain and Europe .
This , Madam President , is the only way forward which we therefore fully support .
Madam President , on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it .
So , Madam President , maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance .
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism ?
Let us make ourselves heard !
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg .
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words , but a demonstration of our actual political commitment .
Secondly , we send our deepest condolences to their families , their socialist colleagues , the Basque parliament and the Basque police force . We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy .
Fourthly , we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country .
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement , as many other colleagues did .
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered .
So far , unfortunately , in Spain and France , just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country .
We , Euskal Herritarrok , are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda .
Before 20 January last , during nineteen months , the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta , member of ETA , in March 1999 .
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police , including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government ' s agreement , ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire .
We , Euskal Herritarrok , have regretted many times the loss of human lives .
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people .
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country .
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament .
May I ask : Quousque tandem - Noiz arte ?
Madam President , thank you for giving me the floor .
I must say that it is very hard for me to follow on from the last intervention .
When Mr Puerta mentioned some of ETA ' s victims , he made no reference to someone who was killed by ETA 16 years ago . I believe he did this out of respect for me .
The person I am talking about was a socialist senator who was also a member of the Basque regional parliament . His name was Enrique Casas .
( Loud applause )
Madam President , Senator Casas was my husband .
I was left a widow with four children , the youngest of whom was only eight months old . My husband was an Andalusian by birth and a senator for the Basque Country .
This was the only time I had spoken of my husband ' s death but I must do so again today and I do it willingly .
Madam President , I was born in Germany , educated in Sweden and married to a Spaniard .
I know what democracy is because I had the good fortune to grow up in a country like Sweden which has a long democratic tradition .
As for the other problems , we can talk about these .
( Loud and sustained applause )
We democrats can solve the other problems by allowing everyone to put forward their ideas , because freedom of expression , free elections and freedom in general do exist in the Basque Country .
The only restriction on this freedom is ETA which must therefore be eliminated .
Then we democrats can talk .
( Loud applause )
Thank you , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop , I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect .
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening .
But we shall have a decision very soon .
( The Minutes were adopted )
Reforming the Commission
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission .
I shall give the floor straight away to the President , Mr Romano Prodi .
- ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , last July , here in your presence , I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission .
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July : the outgoing Commission had been in crisis , I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination .
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission , to reform it thoroughly , completely revolutionising the Commission ' s way of working .
Today , that commitment has been fully discharged : you have the reform here , before you , in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission .
I would like to emphasise that , on that occasion too , the Commission voted unanimously , with one voice .
Briefly , these are the main points of the reform .
One : definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources .
In this context , activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives , actions and resources .
The second point is human resources .
It is the central part of our reform . Our staff are the Commission ' s best asset , its richest resource .
They are extremely highly qualified , of a calibre which it is difficult , if not impossible , to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used .
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission , and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work .
All this has to change , and this is one of the main reasons for our reform .
These are the areas in which changes will be made .
The third point , which was also rather a sensitive , key issue in the recent crisis , is financial management .
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security .
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General .
This is a complete revolution of the Commission ' s way of working ; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking .
In fact , the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world .
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology .
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration .
This is not just a technical revolution , but a complete organisational revolution as well .
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff , who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission .
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and , in my opinion , it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well .
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever .
Now we can focus on the future , on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005 , the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks .
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan .
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission , a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions .
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities .
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity .
For this reason , we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently .
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission ' s disposal , but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them .
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future .
In September , we undertook to present a White Paper on reform , and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence .
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve .
I would , however , remind you , and this is my final point , that the Commission is not the only Community institution .
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms .
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague , Michele Schreyer , to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning : " Reforming the Commission " .
Together with Romano Prodi , I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses .
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context .
In the Commission , systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred .
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are , of course , basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised .
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too .
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind , and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere .
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance .
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide .
The House will be aware , of course , that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone .
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly .
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum .
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House .
Last month , as Romano Prodi has just said , we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September .
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years .
Inevitably , that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended .
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union .
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission .
And when that assessment is complete , we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us .
If they are proven not to be , we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority .
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both .
In each of the three pillars of reform , the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital .
The new activity-based management system , that the President just mentioned , will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time .
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will , therefore , be vital .
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest .
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will , therefore , be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management .
In human resources policy , the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable .
Again , that will be a very demanding challenge .
In the limited time available for this statement , it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals .
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years , and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon .
It is clear , of course , that in many ways the really hard work starts now , with the implementation of our proposals .
Thank you , Commissioner Kinnock .
We shall now move on to Question Time .
Madam President , the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials .
Recently , the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions .
There is effective legal precaution .
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process .
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock , if I may .
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms .
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation , and clearly that is a major concern .
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside .
I suggest that is too long , and we really must move forward much more quickly than that .
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology .
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about , because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms .
Cultures are products of structures and systems , and the structures and systems have become old .
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour .
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices .
I do not use those as an excuse .
I would like everything to happen much more quickly . It is better to do it absolutely properly .
Madam President , we admire Mr Kinnock ' s vision and sense of realism .
For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is , at the same time , drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated .
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities .
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first .
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities , because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise .
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context .
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace , it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board .
We must resolutely switch from our present , rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace .
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities ?
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House .
I do believe that reform with all it implies , including the new mechanisms , will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind .
Two questions if I may .
We anticipate , if I understand correctly , a report in September on core activities .
Let the managers manage .
So far as the September communication is concerned , it is unprecedented .
That is a sensible forecast to make , it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain .
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks .
Financial control will be absolutely secured , both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes , and because we will introduce a completely professional , independent internal audit service .
As I said earlier , our ambition is total security for money and value for money .
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us .
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that .
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage .
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation .
So , the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all .
Coherence , consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures .
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control , the ex ante system can be used .
Naturally , there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage .
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system , it most certainly can be used .
Lastly on transition , I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called " soft law " .
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper .
Two other points I must make , because this is an essential question central to reform .
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia .
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline .
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials , the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system .
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring .
Lastly , the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable .
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction .
Madam President , great importance has been attached to the reform process , which deserves to be acknowledged , although this may be somewhat premature .
My question is this : there is a need for reform , due not least to the accession of new countries , and thus to the enlargement of the Union .
How can we - the Commission , Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively , taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries ?
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another .
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament , the national parliaments and also the Commission , and the work they perform together , more effective ?
It is essential that we have that reform , both for the sake of the current Union , and certainly to facilitate accessions .
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering .
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see .
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it .
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David ' s Day .
Thank you for the presentation .
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public .
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time .
Excessive paperwork . Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control ?
That is a clear complaint that we get . That needs to be addressed .
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee .
This , of course , is welcome , but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure .
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee ' s work ?
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words .
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words , but we will try to lead by example .
As far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan .
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent .
I know I can rely on everyone here .
That concludes Question Time .
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock .
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy .
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again , here in the European Parliament .
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent .
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened .
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas , particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union .
However , I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki .
I will speak of this briefly . If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time , I will be pleased to answer them .
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago .
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent .
These were essentially of three types which I will describe .
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events .
Therefore , two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision , a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union .
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch .
You can be satisfied with the progress made .
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months .
Secondly , the Military Committee , which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries , will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration .
This Military Committee , as you can imagine , will have various duties .
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces .
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics , not for military purposes , but with strictly humanitarian ends .
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination , drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki .
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission .
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you .
We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility .
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us , including this House .
I will set this out in five points .
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can , on this date , do its job and do it well .
Secondly , we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries .
Thirdly , we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide .
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs .
How can we do this ?
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this .
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils , those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency .
Madam President , we are therefore working on this issue with determination , energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government .
I have two further points to make on this process .
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which , although geographically in Europe , are not members of the European Union .
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises , which I hope will not be the case , all forces and all countries will be more than welcome .
Secondly , we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO .
The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types .
The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO .
The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them , but using the means and infrastructure of NATO .
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone .
However , we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well .
As far as possible , we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans .
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten .
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well .
In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission .
I am not going to say much more on these issues .
However , I would prefer , Madam President , to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them .
However , before this happens , I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya .
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating .
In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations .
In Grozny , there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat .
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you .
Madam President , this brings me to the end of my speech .
I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning .
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world .
Thank you very much indeed , Mr Solana . I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering , on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
Thank you , Mr Poettering .
Mr Poettering , it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten ' s participation in this debate is most opportune , and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes .
Commissioner , would you like to speak now or a little later ?
( The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later ) Very well , thank you .
Madam President , Commissioner Patten , Mr Javier Solana , usted no es una persona loca , todo lo contrario ( you are not mad , quite the opposite ) .
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit .
We know that you have an important role in this .
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today , and in this context , and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question .
We cannot , of course , talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya .
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group .
I want to concentrate on Kosovo .
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means .
The KFOR forces have made , and are making , an invaluable contribution , but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term .
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica .
They have now been replaced by robust Danish , Finnish and Swedish troops .
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred , but it is important for the sake of Kosovo , the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail .
Through the Stability Pact , we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation .
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union ' s common foreign and security policy .
At the moment , there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo .
Last autumn , we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force .
I am now delighted to hear that , this weekend , Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing .
I hope that this discussion will , in the first place , concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied .
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot , for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management , an idea which has already been translated into practical action .
Another , at least as important , lesson of our experience , however , is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently .
Therefore , the EU must also have an independent , credible conflict-prevention capacity .
On behalf of the Commission , Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction .
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations , together with a Commission Crisis Centre .
My last question to Mr Solana is this : what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind ?
How have these been organised by Mr Solana ' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission ?
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian , peace-keeping and peace-making tasks .
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights .
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament .
You must lay these concerns to rest for , as you yourself have said , when we are able to present a united transatlantic front , we are in a position to do something .
When we are divided , we are weakened , and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged .
So , maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway , Turkey and Canada , either .
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers .
As George Robertson has said so often , we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo .
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war .
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats .
Everything else is wishful thinking .
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment .
We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra .
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny .
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States .
No soldier can , of course , be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament .
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army .
It will be a force comprised of various national units .
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment .
However , there is , of course , also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament .
As someone who both speaks and listens , we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
Finally , I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion .
Yesterday , a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister .
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much .
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table .
We share your delight , as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired .
Mr President , Mr Solana , we are all behaving like children .
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers .
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004 , 2005 , 2006 .
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000 ?
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles . I have received an e-mail from a former colleague , Pierre Pradier , who is in Pristina at the moment .
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina .
He treated Roma , Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo .
A man with three children and he was murdered .
We need policemen in Kosovo right now !
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice .
I am not a warmonger , but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo , then what is the point in having soldiers at all ?
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo , but that is the price of freedom at the moment .
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation , Serbian provocation , Albanian provocation , etc. we are heading for war .
Tell me , what civilian forces are being mobilised , Mr Patten ?
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so .
He is not always right , but in this case he is .
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria , but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia .
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party , whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party !
In the current situation , we should say to the Russians " If you want money , if you want us to reduce your debts , you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia " .
If not , we are not prepared to pay for their war , since , by reducing the debt , by giving them money , we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres .
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers .
It is not enough just to say , " You , the murderers , please stop the slaughter ! "
They know full well that they should not commit these acts .
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good ?
But that is his strategy , he instigated this war .
From the beginning , he wanted this war in order to become president .
So that is the world as it is today .
For that reason I say to you : my Group is not entirely in agreement , but I am in favour of European defence .
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments .
First of all , the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers .
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements , we shall not be credible .
Mr President , Mr Solana , we are very uneasy about replying to you because , in our view , you are responsible for an area that does not really exist .
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of , at Sintra , the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is ' pretentiously ' called autonomous .
What interests will this so-called force defend , in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests ?
Let us just consider for a moment . What is the basis of armed action ?
It is the defence of a territory , the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital ?
In short , what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy ?
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one ' s own interests .
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system .
It is still the old imperial service .
You might have added , Mr Solana , ' to give me their instructions ' , because that is what we see , in fact .
In the case of the Balkans , just like everywhere else , one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it .
Yes , Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you , Daniel Cohn-Bendit . In every case , it is follow-my-leader syndrome .
Do you think I am going over the top ?
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience .
Echelon is one of many examples of this , giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here .
The experts speak of a cultural problem , I think they might be right !
On behalf of the combined European right , I must say to you , Mr Solana , as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy , we do not have confidence in you .
You say that you are against war , but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war .
Today , even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for .
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern , that is the least one can say .
Secondly , if you do recognise this right , then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on ?
I can already hear your reply : humanitarian standards .
In Kosovo , it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia .
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama , it was not to impose their politics , it was to combat drug trafficking .
When they landed in Somalia , before having to withdraw in disarray , it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route , it was to restore hope .
' Restore hope ' , do you remember ?
In a nutshell , can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons .
Finally , you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management .
Not to make war , of course , but to protect peace .
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions .
Mr Solana , these questions convey our concern .
You say that you are against war , but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that .
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward .
Mr President , it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year : Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary .
As candidate countries of the European Union , they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning , that is to say as of now .
This request , however , was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year .
In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation .
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative , Mr Solana , to what extent Prague , Warsaw and Budapest are , or will be , involved in European military crisis management plans .
Given Poland ' s rather critical stance , this question is all the more pressing .
Its reservation is captured in the following , rather blunt wording : avoid American isolationism and European separatism .
If anything , the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO " .
We all very much share this opinion .
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today .
The Czech Defence Minister , for example , shares this opinion . In the autumn of last year , the latter stated : " Security within Europe is not divisible .
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries , with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions " .
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana .
Poles only need five words for this : nothing about us without us !
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries ?
Mr President , I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members ' questions this time round .
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective , visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union .
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies .
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy .
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about .
This meeting was based on two documents , one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union .
Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect ?
Mr Solana , as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , I shall limit my speech to those subjects .
You have , Mr Solana , heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo , Chechnya and elsewhere .
For my part , I do not wish to give up hope .
And today , as far as you are concerned , I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed .
Indeed , we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective , in any case , the objective that I wish to achieve .
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the " what is to be done " variety .
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December , without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon .
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings ?
And finally , what do you most need at these next summits ?
My second question is different , although it is not unconnected with the previous one .
It concerns the next IGC .
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February .
Can you tell us your position on this subject ?
Mr President , Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe .
At long last , the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative .
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent .
However , if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times , the Treaty must include a flexibility clause .
Mr Solana can play an important role in this .
He is not stupid .
Certainly not !
He is a driven man , a competent man .
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence .
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council , Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU , as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit .
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep , Mr President .
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten , as has been illustrated again today , in fact .
It appears that , as European security and defence policy takes shape , the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold .
This too is unacceptable in my view .
Naturally , every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient , but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power .
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself .
Mr President , peace is the European Union ' s very raison d ' être .
I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly .
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy , cultural diversity and tolerance . But look at us now !
Some of them are our ACP partners .
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment .
In Kosovo , we stepped in with military means , having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia .
We are now unable to guide the peace .
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union .
I do not believe , Mr Solana , that we can restore this credibility by military means .
At the moment , Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of .
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level .
In my opinion , it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment , which are such nice toys , after all .
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea .
Mr President , allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo .
Today , we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities .
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that , in a militarised European Union , NATO will have the upper hand .
Commissioner , Mr Solana , there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas .
I wonder , and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members , about the direction in which we are going .
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union , which was an integrated process within the Community structures , today , unfortunately , the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure .
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union .
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy , but the process must be clear .
I also believe that we should not underestimate , and this is a question that I put to you , the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries .
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community .
Today , they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy , and I believe that they are working with that in mind .
Finally , with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo .
Without this status , there will only be instability , murders , provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter .
Finally , I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives , as we say in common parlance , are getting a bit much .
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice , for example .
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates , we have still not had a trial , and we still do not know what is happening .
As far as tourism is concerned , there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium , for example .
But I do wonder what his own view is on this .
According to the documents , cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful .
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light ?
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent .
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course .
The Treaties also point in that direction , although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar .
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar .
Actually , I hear less and less about this .
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation , which would work very well .
But is there not more to it than that ?
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy , NATO ' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence .
The European pillar does not really function any more as such .
Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks .
Is this actually how we want things done ?
Moreover , whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union , there is no longer any mention of Article V , which is , of course , of direct concern to us .
Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg .
Will it be omitted ?
At the same time , an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets .
I think that this is to be welcomed , but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider , collective defence tasks .
I wonder how this will develop .
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future .
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling ?
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy .
I do wonder , if Turkey were to bring in a brigade , would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy ?
The fabric of Turkey ' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities .
That would seem odd to me .
Secondly , the Baltic States are also knocking on our door .
Will they also take part in our defence policy ?
It is a very interesting position to be in , to say the least .
However , this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further .
A word of warning to the latter : this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation .
Do you think that any of these issues could be included , at least in the agenda of the current Conference ?
Mr Solana , I am sitting quite close to you , close enough to see your face .
I think that you have aged , your face is quite lined .
You are Spanish ; you are from a large country , Mr Solana . Spain and Franco were not one and the same .
Today , you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina , with Montenegro and with southern Serbia . It is you who has created this mess .
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work .
My first question , Mr Solana , will be simple and more direct , perhaps , than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me .
You know the French proverb , ' Nothing for nothing ' .
My second question is of a more technical nature , but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible .
You have told us , in this regard , that three committees are being set up , a political committee and a security committee , which started up today , and a military committee .
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union .
Could they , for example , have a place , at least as observers , in the different political and security committees or in the military committee ?
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion .
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles .
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt .
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative , without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee ?
Mr Solana , it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure .
Of course it is , but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful .
In any case , it is prevention that I would like to discuss today .
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf .
If this happens , the United States ' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention .
As we sit here , hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique .
This has not just happened .
The flooding has been going for weeks , and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need .
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic .
Of course , there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance , and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries .
These are of long standing , but are being addressed already within NATO .
After all , the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table .
NATO is largely European .
Now , what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide .
How can we describe the rapes , the looting , the deliberate fires , the deportations , which are called " cleansing " , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe ?
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres ?
The war in Chechnya proves , if proof were necessary , that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers .
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war , to the exclusion of any other objective .
Mr High Representative , you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki .
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world .
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council , as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state , in maintaining international peace and security .
However , we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council , as referred to at Helsinki , was contested recently .
The point is : does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism , which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions ?
What about the infrastructures ?
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy ?
Secondly , what will happen to the European defence industry which , after all , comes under the more general activities relating to this system ?
Will current programmes continue to be implemented ?
Finally , if the Treaty needs to be amended , how do you think this amendment will be implemented , following the report to be submitted in Feira ?
How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting ?
Has any thought been given to the matter ?
Has it been discussed ?
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient ?
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement .
That said , I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far .
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels .
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure , because some Member States spend considerably more than others .
And indeed , some Member States are not geared for mobility .
They are very static in their military forces , and unsuitable for this sort of warfare .
And finally , can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development .
We cannot leave it simply to governments .
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra . They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy .
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction .
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate .
However , while all these developments are indeed welcome , I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions .
I am anxious to know how effective the EU ' s policy planning and early warning unit has been .
While Commissioner Patten ' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune , I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information .
I would also like to support Mr Titley ' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area .
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy , then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises , particularly humanitarian ones , are essential prerequisites .
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations .
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya .
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya .
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for , in principle , in relation to human rights .
So , I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya .
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end ?
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them , but we are choosing not to use them .
Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , I have two questions for you , Mr Solana .
Meetings are all very well , but it is the result that counts .
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper .
If we look around , the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk .
Take , for example , Germany ' s defence savings . These are not only of concern to the defence minister , Mr Scharping .
Instead , they also affect the whole of Europe . In my own country , Sweden , the objective , and the commitment towards playing our part , is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations .
In the present situation , the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men , due to reduced defence spending .
My second question concerns the following matter . Some weeks ago , you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media , whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters .
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative .
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject .
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament .
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well .
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy , of conflict prevention and crisis management .
Rightly , the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that .
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative ' s policy unit .
It is , I repeat , breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo , policing elsewhere , is the most dramatic and obvious example .
It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner .
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green .
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job , and writing a very good report , just to respond to my honourable friend , on policing in part of my own country .
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying ' What in your view is the ideal community police officer ' and the reply was ' a black grandmother ' .
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo .
We have armed forces , we have all got experience of training community police officers .
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing .
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well .
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences .
So again , rhetoric and reality .
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate .
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon .
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights , between neglecting habeas corpus , between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance , between tyranny and between environmental degradation .
All those things come together .
So , in the coming months , we will be producing communications from the Commission , for example , which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises .
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines , actually the use of sensor equipment .
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique .
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells , they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools .
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days , moving those anti-personnel mines around ?
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise .
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere .
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related .
Now , I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric .
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia , Albania , Kosovo .
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans .
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council , the General Affairs Council and Ecofin .
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver .
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses .
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia
Where is the beef ?
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy .
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view .
I want us to be in a position in which we can say : ' It is not like that any more .
We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can ' .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue , for it makes things a little more interesting .
Women in the decision-making process
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process .
Mr President , firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject .
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words .
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process , in both the political and the economic and social spheres .
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole .
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making .
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women .
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent .
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women .
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women , who are ready and able , to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process .
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system .
Some Members have even come out against this .
Personally , I would not want to feel like a quota , to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman .
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference .
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner ' s statement ; it is time that fine words were translated into action .
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves .
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems .
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this .
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process .
In the meantime , we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures .
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen .
It is also worth noting that International Women ' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years .
In 1910 , a woman ' s right to vote was on the agenda .
Today , we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process .
Women are no homogenous collective .
Women belong to different social classes . Women have different individual needs and interests .
In my own country , Sweden , a number of political parties have , in recent years , voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run .
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which , in turn , has provided opportunities for further research .
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making ?
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes , so too of course do the types of decisions made .
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender , the word " qualifications " also crops up .
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined .
It often looks as if men today , as in the past , always have the least defined qualifications .
Being a man therefore seems , in itself , to be synonymous with maximum competence .
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today ' s decision makers .
Earlier this year , we requested , here in this Chamber , that 8 March be made into an international holiday .
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world .
Finally , I want to say , as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close , that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother .
We do not have any such officers , but black grandmothers are in fact to be found .
Mr President , the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness .
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics .
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible .
In France , 95 % of elected representatives are town councillors .
The vast majority of them are not members of any party .
In the authorities of the French departments , the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives , in right-wing or left-wing categories .
In order to be elected as a local councillor , you just have to want to be elected .
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates .
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union .
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination , whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities .
The policy of minorities , while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family , to establish superficial divisions , is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system .
On the one hand , if we establish quotas for women , why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group , quotas of Catholics , of workers , of those who wear glasses .
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women .
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions .
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation .
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs .
On the other hand , such a policy shows a deep contempt for women .
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised .
Ladies , have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota ?
Women deserve more than a quota .
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality .
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today .
The presence of women in decision-making bodies , in particular , is a question of democracy .
All citizens , both men and women , should be able to see , to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule .
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan , where I live , 90 % said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day .
Women work an average of 60 hours a week , which is 20 hours longer than men .
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time .
If this is true , and it is , any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point .
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe , but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation .
Mr President , before I came here for today ' s sitting , I was watching Finnish television .
In Finland , an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic , with the words " Good morning , Madam President . "
Finally , I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference .
I appeal to you , ladies and gentlemen , not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4 , to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference .
This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process .
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy .
It is quite logical , it is consistent !
So , there should be no positive discrimination to include women .
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense .
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics , I want to say - no , definitely not .
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training ?
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority .
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men , particularly in politics .
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women ' s participation in the political decision-making process .
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , " Women are half of heaven " , a successful man once said .
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities , there is a lack of women ' s voices .
Women , who constitute more than half of the population , are heavily under-represented within political , economic and social fields .
That is unacceptable in a democracy .
Where equality is concerned , the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making .
If we are to achieve a balance , a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required .
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women ' s full participation in power structures and decision making .
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind .
The latter are consequently accorded low priority , and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted .
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts , conflict resolution and reconstruction work .
In the resolution , we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping .
Not to use women ' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste .
Women should not only be " half of heaven " but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today .
We have high hopes for what you will achieve .
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions .
In order to achieve this , women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has , until now , been essentially imbued with masculine values .
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for .
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory : not over men , not over anyone , but the victory of equality between men and women .
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities , and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now , and particularly women , concerns the new economy and the new information technologies .
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women .
The rate of employment in Europe , which is much lower than in the United States and Japan , must be increased .
We must therefore have many more women in work , and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall .
Moreover , I have heard that for the next elections , it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece .
I think this is a very sad state of affairs .
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda .
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution .
I myself , Commissioner , am a product of quotas .
I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result .
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance .
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas , and you yourself made reference to Belgium , Commissioner , where it has not really taken off .
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas .
Indeed , Minister , we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract .
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this .
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system , as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis .
I would suggest the following : where possible , apply it on a voluntary basis , where there is reluctance , impose it .
Mr President , I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and , above all , for their proposals .
In an article entitled " If women ruled the world " , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics , the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence .
Athena , the goddess of wisdom and war , may have been a female model in Ancient Greece , but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace .
There are , therefore , serious grounds , over and above justice between the sexes , for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women .
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue , reconciliation , an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means .
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today ' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone .
Mr President , why do women need their rightful share in political decision making ?
And how should we achieve this ?
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary .
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and , as such , a condition for political legitimacy .
But if we look into how to achieve this , the opinions are greatly divided .
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment , much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties ?
And is it then up to the state , in other words the legislative , to impose such measures on political parties ?
Or should we even consider a system in which 50 % of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies ?
In my opinion , the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level .
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists , without which , in fact , I would not be here today .
Like Mrs Van Lancker , I am a product of such a measure .
In my opinion , though , the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties , at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself .
In other words , the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid .
We would , in this way , violate democracy .
Mr President , today ' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe .
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors , education , work , culture .
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres .
The debate is a deeply political one .
There are two approaches .
The first is a policy of persuasion . Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved .
Three comments : the first is based on the fact that women are able . I can , therefore all women can .
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded ? We are able but the rest of the female population is not ?
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics .
Because women have to deal with different realities .
Because they have fewer opportunities .
Because they have a different level of education .
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders .
Not necessary !
They have all been persuaded !
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women .
There is not one party , from the far left to the far right , which does not stress the need for women to take part .
On paper !
Thirdly , we must expect things to change gradually .
The women ' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light .
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level , it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women .
As far as Europe is concerned , as far as the European Parliament is concerned , where there is a quota for the involvement of women , it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation .
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women .
Quotas alone are not enough .
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history .
On this we are clear . Quotas are one of the ways , one of the policies needed to bring about change .
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow morning .
Floods in Mozambique
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique .
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The Commission is following with very great concern , as I know all honourable Members will be , the emergency situation in Mozambique .
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods , about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance .
Several people have lost their lives , many have disappeared , many have been injured .
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries .
The international community including the United States of America , Switzerland , South Africa , Ireland , Norway , Denmark , Italy , Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance .
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground .
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission .
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far , perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks .
First of all , from 1986 to 1989 , I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique .
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems , with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war .
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique .
Secondly , that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society .
Thirdly , we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention , how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively .
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far .
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care , water and sanitation .
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation , provision of shelter , plastic sheeting , jerry cans , blankets , those sorts of things .
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson .
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon .
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent .
I repeat , Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy .
The credit for Mozambique ' s success story must be shared equally by its government , by the opposition , but above all , by the people of Mozambique .
There have already been hundreds of deaths .
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters , followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid .
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment : search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid , including food aid .
I would like to emphasise , however , that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing .
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods .
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial , because otherwise there can be no development . It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique ' s debts .
If nothing is done now , we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste .
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves .
Mr President , it has already been said that , after a war which engulfed the country in misery , Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions .
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died , we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops .
They urgently need aid such as food , water and shelter in order to survive .
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics , which have apparently already broken out , and aid for reconstruction .
However , the aid needed now is difficult to get through , despite the efforts of the NGOs , because the roads , bridges and railway lines are damaged .
Helicopters are therefore needed .
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees .
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow .
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters , including preventing conflicts , is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique .
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term .
However , Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans .
Mozambique , which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster , just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable , is excluded from these plans .
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia , Central America and the Caribbean .
This is reasonable and we support this , but we have to ask the Commissioner , why not Africa ?
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission ' s humanitarian aid policy .
In view of all this , we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States , on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique .
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars .
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency .
Mr President , the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency .
Each day , each hour of delay costs many lives .
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims .
The water levels continue to rise .
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable .
It is as if the whole world is looking on , helplessly .
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness .
I must admit that I have my doubts about this .
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today .
In European terms , this may be swift action , but given the emergency in Mozambique , this is probably very late .
Unlike a number of Member States , the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far .
What options does the Commission have , to offer effective help fast ?
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of ?
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far ?
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner ?
Mr President , all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique .
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons , a large number of dead , a lack of food and drinking water , and homes and crops have been destroyed .
And this is happening in a country which , because it is one of the poorest in the world , does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary .
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help .
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation , representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique .
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment , and only international solidarity can save them .
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us .
Mr President , I would like to begin by emphasising , first of all , the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique .
They are no longer there , having been swept away in the torrents .
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft , especially helicopters , of which it is clear that too few are in action .
As the President of Mozambique , Joaquim Chissano , remarked in a dramatic appeal , each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans .
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively , in terms of quantity as well as quality , and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this .
We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity , but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world .
It is true that Mozambique ' s democracy is still far from perfect , as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them .
As has already been said , helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid .
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all .
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique , as I have myself , and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake .
Children have lost parents , families are bereft , hopeless , helpless and they have lost absolutely everything .
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region .
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet .
85 % of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is .
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing .
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million .
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there .
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift . As you say tons of food , water purification equipment , tents , blankets .
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources .
Are we ready to pay for those resources ?
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured .
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country .
Thank you , Mrs Kinnock .
Mr Nogueira , we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
Union Economy ( 1999 )
This is the challenge .
In Europe , in your rapporteur ' s opinion , this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years , not just once but repeatedly .
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing .
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates .
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion , what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn ?
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts .
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy , the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows .
This was the first pillar of my recommendation .
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People ' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable .
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra .
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy , something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation .
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects .
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee .
We clearly have different views , one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence .
Yesterday , when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent .
Moreover , several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus .
Furthermore , the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level .
However , we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws .
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union , on average , it is EUR 1 600 .
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention .
This is the objective , in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament : give hope to the people of Europe .
There is indeed economic recovery , but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe .
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished , and even reversed , the meaning of his message .
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them , despite our efforts , and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment .
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report ?
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008 , by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions .
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport , energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet .
Secondly , even the growth rate of 3 or 4 % , something we consider eminently feasible , will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth .
And we should say so very clearly , it will involve more savings on services , more third systems , more reductions in average working hours , whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things .
Thirdly , we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe , but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital .
Mr President , I think that this policy will engender not hope , but deep disappointment in European workers .
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts , who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas , failed miserably to muster any support .
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and , in this sense , does not intend to support this resolution .
It will be voting against it .
We are well aware of these handicaps , which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility , the excessive mandatory levies .
But let us not forget that there is another one , a new handicap , with the single currency .
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission ' s report .
But , in reality , we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation .
Mr President , the present draft resolution is controversial .
Given the topic it covers , this is hardly surprising .
It is , after all , a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things , especially where the future is concerned .
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment , but it is , in fact , a short-term policy .
Even if he advocates sustainable growth , sustainability does not come into it .
Given the environmental and demographic developments , if anything , we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy .
More investments , production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity .
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes .
If Member States do not do anything about this , there will be even fewer means for care , education and other important public amenities in the future .
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd .
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which , at 2 % , is now at its maximum permitted level .
If , despite this , there is a desire to increase public spending , then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again .
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises , in particular .
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us , especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting .
Promoting employment , however , is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy .
Member States , in particular , should adopt an effective policy .
In order to achieve this , they must be given the necessary leeway .
Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs .
However , shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us .
Not the report he presented to us here today , but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , because politically speaking , these are two completely different reports .
In very general terms , we could call the first report a left-wing one , as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones .
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report ?
He proposed an ambitious report , based on an optimistic Europe , which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve .
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets .
Why , for example , was the proposal to increase Europe ' s active population to 75 % of the total population removed , when we currently have levels of around 60 % ?
An active population of 60 % is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries ' levels of production with such a low rate of employment .
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive .
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit , we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training .
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate .
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau , according to which what we need is a flexible workforce .
What we want , therefore , is for Europe to enjoy economic growth , but also be prepared to address social issues .
Mr President , like many others , I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report .
When I read the report and see the picture of the EU ' s economy that is described there , I think it is quite a worrying picture .
Investment levels are too low , unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth .
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself , which is something I agree with .
There is far too much talk about stability , convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development .
As far as I am concerned , EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy .
My conclusions about this differ completely , however , from those of the previous speaker .
In this context , I can , in fact , see the EMU project ' s main weakness , for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above .
Instead , you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States .
In terms of outlook , the document points to an upswing , to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this , which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon .
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one , for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy .
We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market , to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures .
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path , rather it makes dramatic statements such as : what we need is state intervention , not the extension and consolidation of the market economy .
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt , and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment , as well as social justice .
That is what the debate we are having is all about , on the subject of which I have this to say to you : we need more freedom and less state intervention .
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment .
Mr President , the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people , it is the generalisation of insecurity , of low wages , of deteriorating working conditions .
But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year .
What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high , and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market .
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc , twenty two thousand at Unilever , ten thousand at ABB / Alsthom Power , not to mention all the others .
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority , the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups .
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us .
This debate , I think , has summed it up .
This report is a wake-up call to Europe .
This report recommends radical measures , which in essence will make it easier to employ people .
It is as simple as that .
The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets .
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that , because Europe has to wake up .
It cannot create jobs just by government spending .
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours , as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people .
The real world simply does not work like that .
And if Europe wants to be left behind , left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism , than yes , vote against this report tomorrow .
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible , my dear Mr von Wogau , for the fall of the euro .
Lastly , the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors ' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services .
Mr President , Mr Katiforis ' s report is exciting .
In its original form , it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy .
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this .
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States ' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure .
This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people , both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States .
The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but , instead , share the EU ' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field .
Society needs , therefore , to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies , poor regions and ordinary citizens .
We have that opportunity right now . Let us grasp it .
Mr President , the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before .
I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers ' view that this is such an interesting debate .
I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions .
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision .
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon .
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities .
The Commission document too , which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon , takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas .
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach , the European Union is taking exactly the right line , not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted .
Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions ?
.
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work .
There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information .
There is also no doubt that , throughout the debate this afternoon , we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies .
However , I believe that there are also some elements of consensus .
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good .
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment .
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today ' s debate .
Yesterday , as some of you have noted , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe .
We currently believe that this improvement , which we highlighted in the perspectives in November , may lead to even better results than initially forecast .
Employment is growing at a good rate .
When we submitted our report , we referred to the risks posed by growth .
We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA , and therefore in other parts of the world , and of a sudden rise in inflation .
Parliament ' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets .
The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem .
Anyway , we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more .
We all agree that , after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment , certain action must be taken .
We need public and private investment .
Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects , among other factors , the imbalances in our labour market .
Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation .
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives ?
In our opinion , the Union ' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity , not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs .
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed .
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth .
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth ' s sake .
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth .
The EU ' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors , on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament ' s analysis .
Firstly , private investment must be assisted .
The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way , but without forgetting public investment .
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital .
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit .
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon .
Common fisheries policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome .
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other .
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation .
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002 , it is important that swift progress is now made .
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation , this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations .
Both biological and economic information are included .
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form .
Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation .
The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data .
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects .
The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme .
Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee .
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission .
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations .
The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one .
Since , however , the Community is funding the exercise , it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment .
Thus , Amendment No 6 , while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations , requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission .
This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1 , 4 and 7 .
Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that , although the data are to be scientifically based , they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes .
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally .
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation .
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole .
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation .
First , in respect to economic data , Amendment No 2 makes two changes .
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued .
The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue , subsidies , interest received , etc . , with a reference simply to volume of sales .
It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality .
In conjunction with these changes , Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly .
Secondly , in respect to the environmental data , the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information .
The Commission has , however , made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind .
It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage .
Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems .
This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary .
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes .
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish .
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts .
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes .
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects .
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority .
More significantly , under Amendment No 1 , the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1 ( b ) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective .
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 ' Internal Policies ' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion .
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available .
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner .
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance , which is not very significant anyway , will not be received .
My Group has included two reasonable requests .
As a result , this report is very satisfactory and , on behalf of my Group , I therefore ask for its approval .
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report .
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish .
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes , even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met .
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission .
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue .
Sound , factual information is in the best interests of the industry .
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice .
It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources , but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase ?
What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d ' Yeu or elsewhere , if Japan , Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch ?
What is more , the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital , it is not European , but world-wide .
Brussels , which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task , now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset .
Together with Mrs Attwooll , I am in favour of collecting scientific data , and of fair and accurate checks , on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations .
But to enlighten the decision makers , let us practise honest science , without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats .
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish , we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen .
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism , as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD .
Mr President , Commissioner , to be able to adopt a credible fisheries policy , the Commission needs comprehensive and reliable data on fish stocks and fisheries fleets at its disposal .
The Commission relies on the Member States for the collation of this data .
A Community framework for the collation of this data adds some structure and improves accessibility for the purpose of scientific evaluation .
The question , however , is whether or not the Member States would be prepared , under this new regime , to make the necessary data available at the requested time .
Effective sanctions and / or incentives , which aim to encourage Member States to adopt a more serious approach , are lacking from the Commission ' s proposal .
Moreover , can we rely sufficiently on this information ?
How reliable is fishing data , as long as there are still large amounts of fish being caught illegally , as British fisherman David Cox recently admitted in Fishing News ?
And what should we make of the data on fleet capacity ?
Further to the Court of Auditor ' s criticism , in January this Parliament adopted my amendment to the Cunha report with a large majority .
The amendment requests independent verification of fleet capacity data .
I would like to know from the Commission how it has processed this recommendation , which is also endorsed by the Advisory Committee .
Finally , radical decisions are sometimes mainly based on opinions presented by biologists .
We therefore have everything to gain from improving the accuracy of biological predictions , for example by certifying the drafting of these opinions .
Furthermore , the Commission must provide sufficient financial means for the inspection of stock levels .
It is also recommended that more use be made of the expertise and experience gathered by fishermen when biological opinions are drafted .
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union .
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing .
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry .
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland , a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue .
That is scandalous , their case ought to be heard .
It should be put on record , and I want to put it on record today .
However , the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission ' s proposal .
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data .
Some have different sectors and , in view of the volume of data to be sent , could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data , if the same deadlines are set .
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly .
Much of this data is confidential , as has also been mentioned , which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises .
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data .
Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises .
I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said .
I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States .
In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information , economic as well as biological .
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes .
I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear , proper economic and biological picture emerging .
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years ' time about the future of the policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry , particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002 .
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities .
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements .
To this end , more extensive , compatible , uniform data is required , and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union ' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted .
A case in point is the Mediterranean , including my country ' s fishing industry .
This is a worthy objective , the implementation of which , however , has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish .
A subsequent regulation , Regulation 1448 , adopted , not by chance , in 1999 , permitted certain exemptions , in particular for special cases .
The time period will elapse on 31 May next , to be precise , when the Commission will present a proposal .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Combating certain fish diseases
Although the virus has been found in other species , the disease itself is so far confined to salmon .
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists ; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures .
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU , spread throughout some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities .
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually .
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and , if possible , eradicated .
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not .
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible .
The proposed changes are twofold : the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle .
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine .
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms , working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm .
I therefore support the Commission ' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation .
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process .
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee .
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text .
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens / European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13 .
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold .
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway .
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective .
In Norway , with their much longer experience , compulsory , 100 % culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation .
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread .
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA .
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers , others will be incorporated into codes of practice .
All will be beneficial , not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required .
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise .
Now , as he said , in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually .
Regrettably , although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago , it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another .
Wild salmon , trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment .
So this report , Mr President , provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease .
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Hudghton , also for this report .
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90 % of the British aquacultural industry .
The industry is located in some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities .
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence .
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical , realistic and also achievable .
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach .
There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report .
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development .
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming .
Secondly , looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening , paragraph 28 is of particular importance .
This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment .
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon , causing death .
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water , etc .
What we currently propose is to relax this directive , so that we do not cull all the fish , but only the fish that are found to be diseased .
For the others , well , we would have time to see what would happen , according to local circumstances .
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way .
What about women ?
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard .
There is another risk to the environment as well , because this disease is transmitted to wild fish , as we have seen .
For this reason , together with my colleague , Patricia McKenna , we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission .
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur .
And people have spoken in the past about BSE .
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed .
Had it been at that time , you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money .
So it also has to do with environmental protection . The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health .
I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening .
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms .
However , this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA .
Nor can it be done , if the proposal involves a threat to public health .
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously .
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals .
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals .
The virus harms cold-blooded animals .
It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would , if present in fish for human consumption , be inactivated when ingested .
In no way , however , can diseased fish be used for human consumption .
As an extra precaution , I am validating this advice to our scientific committee .
During the debate , a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation .
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry .
You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000 , under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance , Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture .
The Commission ' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument .
Council Decision 90 / 424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks .
I must emphasise , however , that there are serious constraints .
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set .
So further thought is necessary .
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90 / 424 .
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5 .
I agree , however , with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers .
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance .
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon .
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations .
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4 .
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers .
Those could perpetuate an infection .
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4 .
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease .
I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom .
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals .
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised .
I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93 / 53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence .
As I pointed out earlier , the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health .
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words , and I quote , " of the highest possible standard " are replaced by " are safe " .
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks .
In this context , a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open .
It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed .
Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment .
For that purpose , I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission .
This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods .
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate .
The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact .
Bearing this in mind , I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter .
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9 , but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join , at the same time , environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies .
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13 .
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk .
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned .
I look forward to Parliament ' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward .
I can partly accept Amendment No 11 .
Finally , I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty .
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward .
We remain committed to eradicating the disease , an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector .
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Byrne .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Protection of juvenile marine organisms
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one .
By now , my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice .
The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna .
This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics , finances and administration , compliance and conservation and management measures .
They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna , with temperate tuna , the north and temperate tuna south and other species .
These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention .
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties .
These conditions are binding , however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period .
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law .
At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela , changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna .
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974 , 1994 and 1996 .
As of now , it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos .
At its recent meeting in November 1998 , the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations .
The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans .
It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine , in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock .
Following all of the research , the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August .
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations .
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine .
The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles .
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age .
The Mediterranean , particularly in some zones , is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value .
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish .
As rightly said by the rapporteur , both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval .
However , I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law .
We are , for example , still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize . The recommendation for this dates from 1996 .
Apparently , according to my information , the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work .
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable .
We have listened to the Commission ' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation . This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy .
Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure .
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem , either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or , if possible , before then .
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms .
Indeed , it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources .
All laudable stuff .
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance .
I do not know what the metric equivalent is .
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues .
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns .
The common fisheries policy is not working .
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation , the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster .
In mixed fisheries , you cannot discriminate .
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless .
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP .
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it .
Let me illustrate this with a topical example .
In February , Commission Regulation 394 / 2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued .
It means that in Fleetwood , 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April .
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done .
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters .
Our rapporteur ' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded .
However , according to the SCRS study , the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries .
The WWF reports that , according to Italian , French and Spanish customs authorities , illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase .
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time .
However , I must again congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Gallagher .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .

Fishing and the environment ( Bergen 13-14 March 1997 ) : 2nd report
Mr President , Mr Fischler , my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues , as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen .
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow , not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but , more seriously , for humanity as a whole .
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect , perhaps more so than most people , both Europeans and non-Europeans , would believe .
We have also asked Parliament ' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries .
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us . We must completely overhaul , modernise or , if you prefer , update this policy in its entirety .
I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised , particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks .
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House .
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy ' s effectiveness which must therefore , in my opinion , be significantly improved .
I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail , Mr President , given the time constraints and also the interpreters ' fees .
However , I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created .
These initiatives , together with effective systems of control , are the key aspects for the future of fisheries .
However , we do not have to resort to extreme solutions , as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report .
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on .
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee .
Maritime transport , industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past .
This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission ' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies .
The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports .
I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things .
Of course , I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting .
This is an unwise policy .
All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates .
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates .
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission ' s worthy intentions in this field , it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made .
One can quote from the communication .
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent .
That appeared in the communication published last July .
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation .
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities ?
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced .
Secondly , the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party .
Thirdly , the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources .
More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils .
Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas .
Such pressures are greatest in Europe .
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches , fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures .
A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative .
The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves .
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry .
At present dear colleagues , we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea , nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system .
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector .
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information , the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism .
I recommend the report to the House .
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments .
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch .
We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy .
After all , the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies .
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard .
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control .
All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected .
Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries .
This is a good step forward , but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out , much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
Mr President , fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment . Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions .
However , some people ' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic , ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators .
I regret to say that this report , due to its link with the environment , seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions .
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious .
Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport .
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong .
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14 , many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely .
Just when we thought the discussions had ended , a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly .
According to these , for example , the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea .
As I have said many times before , the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika .
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which , in his opinion , could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea .
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated .
However , what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations .
Maritime transport , employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment .
As for the Structural Funds , certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day .
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries .
The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria . The same yardstick should be used for everyone .
As Mr Katiforis says , discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept .
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back .
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear .
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector .
It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message .
Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control , damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity .
Mr President , I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment .
We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity , but also from domestic activity .
I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea , and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean , when we want to clean up purification plants , is a good way to clean up water .
They say that if you want something done , it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea , the fishermen , must be very attentive .
So we must practise selective fishing .
Aquaculture should also be monitored .
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion .
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments .
We welcome the report ' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system , as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States .
In effect , this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management .
More specifically , with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean , we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs .
And just as well , in my view .
In our opinion , the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate .
Lastly , we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left .
There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment .
A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation .
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene , the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors .
Firstly , fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin .
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living , for without it , the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed .
Secondly , it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries .
This particularly applies , however , to our own coastal waters .
Given this context , I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago .
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it .
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep .
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally .
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense , without any real negotiation or discussion .
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period .
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia , it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland .
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide .
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Bankruptcy procedures
Mr President , I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created .
We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and , what is more , concepts .
The very word bankruptcy , the legal concept of bankruptcy , does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union .
We therefore all agree on the established facts , and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction .
If I may , however , just make a few comments on the method .
The first is to establish equivalence , saying : in the final analysis , bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany .
The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo , that is to say , to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States .
That is not the route that has been taken .
The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems , which are not touched , a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty .
This is a good thing , moreover , and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for .
But at this stage I should like to make an observation , which is not technical , but more philosophical and taken from practice .
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union , in the majority of States , as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects .
Today , in many Member States , that is not possible .
When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market , we must also deal with the darker side , namely bankruptcies .
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard .
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report .
I am , moreover , proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council .
I think it is an important step we are taking , even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it .
To the rapporteur ' s regret , I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors ' legal position and impairs their legal protection .
With regard to Amendment No 6 , we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee .
I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then .
We shall now support your Amendment No 6 , but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee .
I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries .
.
For better or for worse , the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life .
This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy .
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention .
As far back as 1981 , the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings .
Furthermore , this view was accepted in the Commission ' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses .
The 1995 Convention , on the other hand , authorises the filing of secondary proceedings , thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted .
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted , one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings .
Consequently , the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment . Instead , it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues .
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person , this idea is clearly defined in Article 3 .
In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed , we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Vitorino .

Shipwreck of the Erika
The next item is the oral question ( B5-0011 / 2000 ) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , to the Commission , on the shipwreck of the Erika .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today .
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments .
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika .
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue .
Firstly , we must show the Commission , the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident .
Secondly , we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster , namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions .
The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future .
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event .
We must now get down to adopting measures , Commissioner .
Firstly , efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport , particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved .
Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport , particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling ' responsible fisheries ' .
Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled .
We expect concrete action from the European Commission . The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important , well-developed and prestigious .
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained ?
How can those affected be compensated ?
This is a very serious problem which the European Union , as an economic , commercial , industrial and fishing power , must tackle .
We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations .
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future .
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries .
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission , with plenty of action and no more regrets .
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups .
Mr President , the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years .
In addition to destroying natural resources , this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors , particularly those dependent on fisheries .
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel , the situation could still deteriorate .
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance . They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which , unfortunately , is not an isolated event .
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature , which is nowadays too often being punished by man ' s activities .
These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities .
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes .
Surely the budget would agree , as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these .
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked .
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January , the needs of the severely affected fisheries , ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account .
We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds .
Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks .
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this .
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen .
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate .
It is time that polluters started to pay because , up to now , it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid , and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well .
I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler ' s response , particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted .
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner .
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable .
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people .
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified , where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two .
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address .
This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future .
Will it really address the concern or will , in practice , in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas , the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause .
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation , and for this to be backdated .
We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats .
Finally , we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic , with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million .
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products .
This is not acceptable .
We only found out too late and , as a result , medical inspection must be provided , paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment .
Finally , we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks , as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage .
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation .
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute , when the disaster is already in progress . Consequently , the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand .
Mr President , over two months after the wreck of the Erika , pollution of the coasts , which have already been cleaned once , is still continuing .
While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this , I should like to salute the dedication of the workers , professionals and volunteers , who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches .
Thanks to the grass-roots involvement , which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January , an initial raft of measures has been announced .
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety , particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection .
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution .
So , yes , Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological , economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster .
The French State has released funds for compensating damage .
I feel , however , that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level .
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence .
I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made , and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House .
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis .
Curiously , the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified .
The ecological disaster is a major one , possibly unprecedented in scale .
Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution .
All workers in the fishing , fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard .
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe .
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions .
As regards fishing proper , passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit .
After shellfish , the slump is now affecting crustacean sales .
The two principle resources of the Atlantic shore , fishing and tourism , both closely interrelated , have both been seriously affected .
There is a danger that the season will be lost , resulting in an extremely serious crisis by the end of the year .
The fact that Parliament is presenting a new resolution , one to which our Group has made a significant contribution , is therefore perfectly justifiable .
It emphasises a number of points deemed crucial at grass roots level .
The first point is that the polluter must accept his liability in full .
The second principle is the ' polluter pays ' principle .
According to our resolution , the polluter ' s liability must extend to fishing , fish farming and aquaculture industries and businesses .
If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient , and it has clearly been underestimated , then it must be raised .
Our resolution calls for this .
If the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance .
Commissioner , the stricken people await tangible expressions of solidarity at European level .
Our resolution calls upon the Commission to take the necessary steps to assist in repairing the damage caused in the fishing industry affected by the consequences of the disaster .
Maritime Europe and the CFP must today demonstrate that , in addition to imposing constraints on fishermen , it is not unfamiliar with the concept of solidarity .
The European Union must also participate in the restoration of the wetland and coastal environments affected , whose biological value is important to the Union as a whole .
Mr Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France ' s requests . I am pleased to hear it .
We must act as a catalyst in this crucial issue of maritime pollution .
Twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster laxness and irresponsibility still reign supreme in Europe in matters of maritime safety , resulting in yet more oil slicks .
This time , we must not let inertia win the day .
A basis for maritime safety must be drawn up speedily , respecting the principle of subsidiarity , and we must at long last put an end to this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility .
Mr President , the economy of the western Atlantic coastline has been devastated , polluted by oil from the Erika .
European citizens find it hard to understand why Europe accepts conditions which the Americans refuse and why Europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has until now blocked any measures to do with maritime safety .
Finally , the Commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line for ' natural disasters involving Member States ' , and make the regions affected eligible for Structural Funds .
What is the Commission ' s view of these proposals ?
What decisions has the Commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take ?
How did the Commission follow up the resolution which the European Parliament adopted on 20 January 2000 ?
We have not , thus far , seen any practical action whatsoever .
Mr President , recent history and the Erika shipwreck , in particular , have shown that our coasts are under constant threat from shipping disasters .
The debate on preventing these disasters has already been held in Strasbourg and it highlighted the importance of a European plan for maritime safety .
In addition to prevention , however , we should not be blind to the ramifications of such disasters , not least the ecological ramifications .
Many hundreds of kilometres of French coastline have been polluted .
Thousands of fish and birds have been killed .
It cannot be ruled out that certain habitats may have been permanently damaged , and the restoration of the environment is often a long drawn-out process .
We must learn from past experiences .
Shipping disasters such as that involving the Erika could well strike again off the Dutch , English , Spanish or Belgian coasts .
The regulations which we are drawing up today in Europe should be regarded as a precedent .
We should therefore be strict with the polluters and generous to the victims .
There are two aspects , the first being the environmental angle .
From this point of view , this fits in with the wish of the French to see their presidency characterised by regulations which work towards increasing safety .
The secondary impact , however , is proving to be on the economy , the primary impact being environmental and only the second economic , as many Members have stated .
Shellfish farming , fishing , oyster farming and fish farming are today seriously affected , for the effects of the oil slick have been compounded by the storm damage affecting many areas .
Unfortunately , these sectors have been devastated : they have first to rebuild and then , perhaps the most difficult thing , to regain consumer confidence .
Confronted with this situation , the inhabitants of Brittany , the Vendée and Charente , as well as the forestry workers in other regions , await a signal from the European Union .
I took very careful note of Commissioner Fischler ' s remarks , perhaps the most practical suggestions we have heard to date .
There have been many declarations of sympathy and solidarity , and many announcements , admittedly , but now it is time for expectations to be met with a tangible display of European solidarity .
These spills , in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage , have devastated local industries .
Effective compensation is essential .
The companies responsible , the ship and the cargo owners must pay up for their negligence .
The current compensation funds are inadequately funded and this was all too apparent in the case of the Braer disaster where the Shetland Islands fishing industry was inadequately compensated for their losses .
We must learn from past experience and make sure that the industries affected by the Braer spill can be rebuilt .
Mr President , today , once again , it is necessary to discuss the Erika disaster , two and a half months after it occurred , because its tragic consequences are far from over .
It is actually not so much a matter of improving safety checks on these flags of convenience , as stipulated in the resolution , as actually working right now to eliminate their existence .
This is the only solution to ensure that seafarers ' living and working conditions are satisfactory , that they are covered by effective legislation and social protection , and that fishing operations and the environment are respected .
Parliament adopts a resolution after every maritime disaster .
Generally it puts forward positive technical measures , some of which are adopted in directives .
If they were applied , they would in fact serve to counter the idea of cutting costs to the minimum , a policy which is maintained through flags of convenience .
It was stated at this conference that disasters account for 5 % to 10 % of oil pollution .
This may be very concentrated and create many problems , but it is industry which is responsible for 60 % of pollution . And , by way of an indication , 10 % is caused by natural pollution .
I would like to advocate this .
I want to thank Commissioner Fischler for his answer to the oral question tabled by our committee .
He has given us some important information . The Commissioners who appear before this House armed with specific and important information are always to be thanked .
With regard to the specific case of the Erika , measures are being taken and action is being coordinated with the French authorities .
Our main concern has been that we do not end up discussing this type of event again .
Preventative measures are the answer to the question of what can we do . It has been said that the Commission will meet to adopt a range of technical and legal measures .
This is the right way to go .
These measures are very welcome and the Committee on Fisheries will monitor these very closely so that we do not have to spend more time in this House regretting such disasters .
I have received 5 motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42 ( 2 ) .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
EC-Israel trade agreement
The next item is the oral question ( B5-0012 / 2000 ) by Mrs Morgantini and others , to the Commission , on the irregular application of the EC-Israel trade agreement .
What we are about to discuss is really very simple : the respect , application and monitoring of the agreements subscribed to by the European Union , and compliance with the Treaties and international standards to which it adheres .
It is very simple , but in this world the simplest things are very often the hardest things to achieve .
At the same time , we also have reason to believe that the Commission is failing to attend to one of its primary functions : guardianship of the Community Treaties .
I will mention but a few , which are produced in the Golan Heights and the occupied territories : wine and other products .
Israel can be certain that Europe is in favour of its security and stability , but it cannot ask us to be party to such grave violations .
The Palestinians know that the European Union is in favour of the consolidation of their State and their rights , but they have no proof of this .
I shall try to provide you with the additional information you are now seeking on this matter .
The EC consequently takes the view that there is absolutely no lack of clarity about the specifications given in his written answer by Commissioner Patten when he said , and I quote in the original English :
" ... as already explained in the communication , Israeli settlements or occupied territories cannot be considered by the Community as part of Israeli territory for implementation of the EC-Israel agreement .
This issue is highly sensitive , in as far as it relates to the broader question of borders , to Israelis and Palestinians alike " .
We have repeatedly stated this position to the Israeli authorities at every official meeting between the Commission and the relevant Israeli minister , the most recent of which was held on 21 January .
On that occasion , the Prime Minister , Shimon Peres , attended a meeting with Romano Prodi , the President of the Commission , and with Commissioner Patten .
It was furthermore widely known , as you have just said , Mrs Morgantini , that Israel ' s interpretation of the territory to which the agreement applies does not match our own .
The Commission believes , however , that our interpretation is completely unambiguous .
Hence , the relevance of your second question on the effectiveness of the verification system .
In our written answer to you , the Commission mentioned simplifying the procedure for determining the origins of a product .
Of course , this does not mean that this alone will solve the problem or , in other words , that simplifying this procedure would automatically lead to a clearer indication of the product ' s origin .
With regard to the new measures , the Commission has , at official meetings with the Israeli authorities , discussed in great detail the issue of the application of the agreement , for which there are clearly defined procedures .
In January of this year , the Israeli authorities suggested setting up a tripartite working group comprising representatives of the Palestinian authorities , of the Israeli Government and of the Commission .
Mr President , the difficulties faced by the peace process in the Middle East are well known .
As for the political obstacles to be tackled , these are all too apparent .
The weight of the political problem is in fact so great that it could discourage us when considering an obstacle such as the incorrect application of this trade agreement , which in principle is only a legal problem .
Specifically and regrettably , in a conflict like the Israeli or Palestinian conflict , everything ends up being politicised if appropriate measures are not taken in time to prevent this happening .
He said that this issue was not on the agenda as this only concerned political issues .
Frankly , I believe that the Commission must act if it is proven that preferential access to Community markets is being gained by products originating from these settlements .
The Union has played an invaluable part in this process , in its capacity as the primary source of economic aid to the region .
The main reason for the problems of implementing trade agreements between the European Union and Israel , as has already been said , is the intractable problem of frontiers .
The Israeli interpretation is not the same as the Union ' s , as the Commissioner mentioned .
At all events , it is a process currently under negotiation , a difficult one , but one that we all wish to see succeed .
The settlement process must proceed by the only possible avenue , i.e. that of dialogue .
A tripartite working group , comprising Palestinian and Israeli specialists as well as those of the Commission , should thus be set up .
In this context , we may hope that the parties involved will manage to settle their differences and establish a creative solution for this transitional period .
As was the case in Europe fifty years ago , the social and economic development of the Middle East is an essential condition for peace .
We therefore have some expertise to bring to bear on the subject and we are particularly well placed to gauge the extent of what has already been achieved .
Hopefully the Israelis and Palestinians will demonstrate the same optimistic faith in goodwill .
Mr President , Commissioner , the peace process in the Middle East is an extremely delicate matter .
It will only be possible for the exact borders of the state of Israel , the only democracy in that region , to be universally recognised once these negotiations have proved to be a success .
The trade agreement between the European Union and Israel , which equally fails to define the territory of the state of Israel , should be implemented against this background .
In addition , there is a significant connection between the economic activities within Israel and those on Palestinian territory .
With this in mind , the Paris Protocol to the Oslo agreements also provides for a customs " envelope " comprising the state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
Furthermore , the Commission and said parties have agreed to set up a joint working party to discuss issues concerning products ' countries of origin .
The Palestinian economy in particular is said to suffer under unilateral EU measures .
Potential investors in this area have already indicated that they would withdraw if joint ventures were no longer given preference .
Mr President , in general terms this House shares the concern expressed in Mrs Morgantini ' s question .
Commissioner Vitorino has clarified the Commission ' s position and , in my opinion , has responded adequately to the concerns raised here . However , I feel that we should not leave the matter there .
Secondly , it is in the interests of both parties to ensure the economic development of the region and to take decisive action to reduce the serious imbalances in the distribution of wealth in the area .
I have to say that I am satisfied with Commissioner Vitorino ' s response : I feel that , on the whole , his speech did respond to the points raised in the question .
This , in my opinion , is the lesson to be learned from such a long-drawn-out affair .
I feel that the two Presidents were right not to include this point in their agendas : there is a time and place for everything and , of course , the priorities are different at different levels .
I feel that it was right for the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission to tackle the most sensitive issues of the peace process which , as we are aware , is still running into difficulties .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is true that the present trade agreement between Israel and the EC is ambiguous .
It is also very difficult to establish the origin of the products in question .
I can therefore only concur that it is desirable for some light to be shed on the matter soon .
There are , nonetheless , a number of other important factors which we need to take into consideration .
Indeed , we are all agreed that the recent revival of the peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hampered .
Israel and the Palestinians are currently involved in intense negotiations concerning their future borders .
Any attempt by anyone , including by any third party , to define - let alone impose - the territorial area to be adopted for trading purposes is therefore premature .
I am pleased that the Commissioner shares this view .
Hopefully , this working party will find a temporary solution to the problem within the existing legal framework without jeopardising the peace process .
For this peace process deserves absolute priority , and we in the European Community and in Europe should not put any obstacle whatsoever in the way of this process .
There seems to be remarkable consensus in the House today but I would like to make a few points .
Here in the Parliament trade in the Middle East has always been a political flashpoint .
Borders are being shut down , sometimes arbitrarily , and sometimes following a terrorist attack .
On one of my many visits to the area , I have seen flowers and strawberries rotting , lying in the streets of Gaza and being eaten by the donkeys while their Palestinian producers look on helplessly in despair .
But it is not just an issue of closed borders .
Goods do flow freely from these territories , goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied territories .
We have an international agreement and it is being transgressed .
It is our responsibility to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected and upheld by all .
Israeli customs can be given a very long time , up to ten months , to reply to any queries and the import verification procedure can be totally unproductive .
We should be requiring deposits on all goods imported from Israel until we are able to ensure that Israel will stop abusing the agreement .
I have a couple of questions , Commissioner .
Has the Commission received from any Member States ' customs services documents certified by Israeli customs that represent specific settlement locations in the occupied territories falling within the scope of the agreement ?
And is the Commission aware whether they apply that territorial clause correctly or not ?
In short , Commissioner , this is not an issue which should be treated as a matter for peace-process-related political debate .
It is , in fact , an international agreement and a trade agreement .
Mr President , it is universally recognised that rules must be observed . It is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules .
Everyone understands that there is concern about this today , but I would not like our demand to be regarded as selectively applicable .
Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment .
Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel .
And because the Commission ' s investigation is not , and must not be perceived as , an indictment , I should like to mention two points which are central to the balance of our approach .
Firstly , anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel .
The Oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
Anything liable to separate the two economies would have a serious effect on cooperation between Israel and Palestine , including joint ventures , Palestinian sub-contractors and exporters .
Secondly , nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the frontiers of the State of Israel defined .
The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers .
I support the cautious approach which the Commissioner has taken and is taking in this matter , firstly because this is not a simple issue .
It is complicated ; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from .
Therefore , because it is not an easy and simple issue , we have to be cautious and we have to be careful .
There is I think one final reason why the Commission should be supported .
We are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement .
You have a government in Israel which wants peace and wants to secure peace and if you proceed in a rash and rapid way then you could jeopardise the success of that peace agreement .
Mr President , it is , of course , unacceptable for breaches of our trade agreement with Israel to be concealed or tolerated .
The EU must now choose between basing its relations with Israel and Palestine on the standards of international law , thereby strengthening the basis of the peace process , and showing disdain for international law .
The choice ought to be simple .
International law prescribes that trade agreements should be established with countries and regions which we recognise and not with disputed territories .
The Commission must guarantee that these things will be done .
Commissioner Vitorino ' s contribution offered some hope that they would be .
The peace process in the Middle East must be given a chance . It can only be founded upon international law .
It is the EU ' s responsibility to contribute to this .
The truth of the situation is that the approach adopted by the Commission on this subject is to seek to obtain the support and agreement of all parties involved in the process .
And what the population of the region is interested in , above all , is peace , and their own economic prosperity .
Lastly , I would like to say that we feel this approach remains true to the principles and the values of the agreement , which we feel is sufficiently clear in legal terms .
Commissioner , I recognise the delicacy of the issue at the moment but I did ask you a couple of specific questions .
Thank you very much , Mrs Banotti .
The debate is closed .
( The sitting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. for the vote and resumed at 11 a.m. )
VOTE
Mr President , in my view , the position is very clear following the debate we had yesterday with Commissioner Diamantopoulou and the President-in-Office of the Council , and Parliament should vote on the original text .
Hence we withdraw our signature to Amendment No 4 .
Thank you very much .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Paragraph 3 :
Mr President , I think there is a mistranslation in the Swedish text .
It would have been a turn-up for the books if the European Left had expressed its concern about a possible increase in taxes on income from capital .
In fact , we voted as we wished to do , but there was a mistranslation in the Swedish text , and I wish this to be noted .
We are assured that all language versions correspond to the original version .

- Attwooll report ( A5-0038 / 2000 )
We know that the Commission is going to reform the common fisheries policy shortly .
This proposal for a Council Regulation is the first in a series which will make it possible to draw up this reform .
The collection and management of the fisheries data is needed to conduct the common fisheries policy .
This data must be reliable , drawn up independently and accepted by all the operators in the industry , politicians and those individuals responsible for the application of this CFP .
The text of the proposal for a Regulation has been amended quite extensively in the Committee on Fisheries .
All the members of our Group voted in favour of these amendments , both in committee and in Parliament .
Amendment No 1 serves to clarify the text considerably .
Specifically , the data collected must not be intended for purely scientific use .
Scientists must process this data and pass it on to the relevant political decision-making authorities .
It is , however , crucial for the data collection method to be carried out in a scientifically justified manner .
Amendment No 2 amends the initial Commission proposal .
What the Commission proposal suggests is drawing up extremely detailed studies of individual vessels and individual businesses .
Regarding the second part of this amendment , it is important that job losses in the industry are counted and identified much more clearly .
Let us not forget that in the administration of a common fisheries policy the statistical analysis used must include the social aspect .
Amendment No 3 makes it possible to add an important aspect : the collection of environmental data .
If this environmental dimension were not incorporated into the management of data , then the Commission would be able unilaterally , just as it pleases , to prohibit the use of any particular type of fishing gear .
Amendment No 4 specifies the obligation upon scientists to process all the data and pass it on to the relevant authorities , including national and regional authorities , in order to contribute to the decision-making process .
Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal .
Amendment No 6 is intended to tighten up the Commission ' s participation in the inspection procedure .
It is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the Commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results .
Finally , Amendment No 7 requires the Commission to produce a report by the end of the year 2001 .
Hudghton report ( A5-0036 / 2000 )
- ( FR ) The amendment to the directive as presented by the Commission is an important one since it deals with a specific disease , i.e. infectious salmon anaemia , a contagious viral disease .
It is a water-borne virus and is transmitted via organic substances such as blood , faecal matter , mucus , etc .
There is no scientific proof of the possibility of vertical transmission of the disease through roe .
It is , however , recognised that other species such as trout , eels or herring , may be carriers of the virus without being affected by it .
The disease was detected in Norway in 1984 and also in Canada ( 1996 ) .
The virus does not survive at a temperature of more than 26º C , and is therefore not dangerous to humans .
The disease chiefly affects the Scottish salmon industry . It was detected in this region in May 1998 .
Today , 240 salmon farms are affected by ISA .
It is therefore essential to contain this disease and prevent it spreading to all the aquacultural establishments in the various Member Sates of the European Union .
The Council proposal envisages setting up a system for the gradual elimination of fish affected by the disease and also a vaccination plan .
We can only declare ourselves in favour of the proposed plan for the gradual elimination of affected fish .
The fish farms concerned must be assisted in ' cleaning up ' the infected site and preventing the disease from spreading through the commercial transport of live fish .
As regards vaccination , we should remember that the initial directive prohibited the use of vaccines against ISA .
The Commission ' s new proposal would authorise the use of vaccines , but it is important to point out that so far , no vaccine has actually been found .
The usefulness of this proposal is limited , to say the least , certainly in the short term .
It is therefore crucial for the Commission to earmark sufficient funding to support the development of an effective vaccine against the European strain of ISA .
Resolution on women in decision making ( B5-0180 / 2000 )
My Group abstained in the resolution on women in decision making , much to our regret .
But even greater is our regret that we still need such resolutions .
This lead has since been followed by a number of parties and it cannot be said that the electorate have risen in protest to condemn such parties for their actions .
Nor have the electorate felt themselves manipulated by such quotas .
The resolution makes clear there is a need for a proportional system that gives form to women ' s representation and that all political parties must take action .
We look forward to that .
We have sympathy with those who argue that people should be selected on their merits ; they should be .
Our culture should allow for a balance between the sexes and people should be able to develop their talents wherever they lie , but our culture and values at the moment do not reflect that belief .
That is why our Group supports positive action and only when women are fairly represented in positions of decision making will men also be fairly represented .
We might also then develop a culture where your paid and unpaid work , your pay packet , your parental leave and your pension are not determined by your sex .
Nonetheless , even though progress has been made in recent years thanks to strategies such as mainstreaming and complementary schemes such as positive action , they are still too few in number to be satisfactory .
Under-representation of women in politics , for example , continues to be the norm .
For , whether in politics or in the labour market , structural discrimination is the main problem facing women .
It is thus up to the European political parties to make themselves more accessible to women .
A condition of this type may have no legal value , but it is nonetheless of great symbolic value .
It gives political parties an important role in building a democratic Europe .
This may , for example , involve implementing positive action and promoting parity within our political parties .
In the 1999 European elections some parties did put forward lists with men and women equally represented .
This is an example of good practice which should be applied more widely .
I do not know if there is some cause-and-effect at work here , but the fact is that the proportion of female Members in the European Parliament went from 25.7 % in 1994 to 29.9 % in 1999 .
Moreover , this Parliament has had a woman president since the 1999 elections .
- Some progress has been made recently in increasing the number of women present in decision-making bodies around the Union .
In our own Institution , 30 % of elected representatives are now women , including the President of the European Parliament itself .
Finland too has just elected a female President .
On average , one quarter of Member State governments are composed of women and a little over one fifth of their parliaments .
This is still far from satisfactory , especially given that the figures vary enormously between Member States where the Nordic countries experience a much higher female representation in positions of responsibility and decision making .
My Group does not favour the use of quotas in general since , in the long run , they can be counterproductive and even undermine the cause they aim to support .
This oppression is based upon a sexual and social division of labour which values men ' s work more than women ' s .
Wages are not equal , women ' s work is still perceived as ' stop-gap ' work and , more generally , female employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men .
What is more , women bear the main responsibility for family matters .
Women must be entitled to full time employment on an equal footing with men .
Mandatory legislation must be adopted in order to encourage equality in the workplace . States must develop a public service offering childcare for working mothers .
Finally , in order to enable everyone , men and women , to become involved in public life , working hours must be drastically reduced .
We need real equality between men and women in political , economic and social life .
We are opposed to the idea that the biological differences between men and women should give rise to two different world views and two different value systems .
Women have the right to be involved in the decision-making process as ' individuals ' and not as token females .
- I , together with my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation , am totally committed to the need to have more women playing a full and active part in public life .
We share in all expressions of regret that there remains inequality and gender discrimination and especially under-representation of women in politics .
However , we are not convinced that one form of discrimination should be countered with another form of discrimination , namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee women elected places .
I feel this especially keenly as only on Tuesday evening of this week my 27-year-old daughter , Caroline , was selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for the Southampton Itchen constituency in the United Kingdom .
She achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against all-comers .
We should not adopt a position that in any way detracts from the position of the increasing number of women who are demonstrating that without fear or favour they can earn their place in public life .
Katiforis report ( A5-0041 / 2000 )
And so we now have no resources left to pay pensions .
We need a completely different system .
These leaders must resign . They do not deserve the loyalty of the elderly of today , nor the young people of today , nor the elderly of 2100 , 2200 and so forth .
.
We have therefore voted against the report in its present form , as all the amendments we tabled were rejected . I would like to highlight the following :
- ( FR ) Our position is determined by the nature of our project for Europe .
Such a policy should bring the overcautious monetarism of the ECB into perspective and should break with the neo-liberal principles of privatisation and undermining social protection .
The free-marketeering Right ' s rejection of the proposed amendments leads us , therefore , to vote against the resolution .
- ( SV ) We have chosen to abstain in the vote on Amendment 4 to the Katiforis report on the EU Economy ( 1999 ) .
Our basic attitude is that competition between different national tax systems is not always a bad thing and that the Member States should , as far as possible , retain their right of decision making in this area .
Tax harmonisation at European level should only take place in exceptional cases , for example in the cases of certain environmental taxes and taxes on capital .
Even if we agree that a certain degree of tax harmonisation is necessary if the internal market is to function properly , Amendment No 4 is altogether too far-reaching and undifferentiated when it comes to this issue .
Joint resolution on the shipwreck of the ( RC B5-0181 / 2000 )
Mr President , we voted in favour of the resolution on the wreck of the Erika out of solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster .
We do , however , deplore the indecisive nature of the resolution .
It is disgusting to see Total leaving the reparation of the damage it caused to volunteers and local authorities .
It is equally disgusting to see the State releasing funds , inadequate funds moreover , which represent nothing more than a backdoor subsidy to this firm and its criminal dealings .
Confining oneself to discussing merely the issue of flags of convenience is dodging the main issue .
Legislation and controls should not only be tightened up but also applied to the letter .
It was made painfully clear that a number of players need to be removed from the pitch in order to ensure that the Erika was the last unseaworthy ship to pollute the Breton coast .
This is the seventh time that Brittany is having to deal with an oil slick since the Torrey Canyon shipwreck .
No other region in the world has had to pay such a high price for the transport of polluting or dangerous substances by sea .
At EU level we would like to see one single piece of legislation drawn up for shipping , encompassing all its technical , commercial , social and environmental aspects .
Without exception , the risky practices of flags of convenience must be banned in the ports and waters of the fifteen Member States and thirteen applicant States .
Secondly , together with the UDB , we would argue in favour of establishing coastguard services and appointing maritime inspectors to work under the direct supervision of the relevant shipping areas and monitor the strict observance of European legislation .
The draft resolution which we have approved contains provisions to this effect , and our Group has therefore given it its full backing .
It takes far better account than our previous resolution of the extent of the disaster , which every day seems to get far worse than anticipated on first analysis and is becoming more exacting , clearer and more urgent .
At this stage it is still difficult to assess the total damage caused to all the fishing , fish farming and aquaculture sectors .
We do already know , however , that it will be extensive .
Every day , further pollution increases the toll .
The degradation does not affect just business turnover but also valuable parts of our heritage .
The effect upon the brand image of seafood products is hard to calculate today .
Fishing and tourism , as the two chief resources in most of the regions on our Atlantic coastline , have therefore both been hard hit .
Hence the need to clearly stipulate , as our resolution does , the principle of ' polluter cleans ' and the principle of ' polluter pays ' .
It is in fact the job of the polluters to pay the costs for cleaning the areas suffering as a result of their actions , and for the restoration of the ecological balance damaged by their actions .
Regarding the compensation system , the citizens are anxious because FIPOL ' s initial compensation payments to victims have been limited to 25 % .
This is just scandalous .
Quite obviously all victims should receive 100 % compensation .
It would be quite unthinkable to insist that victims should bear any part of the costs of the damages they have suffered due to the incompetence of a polluter .
This procedure should be adopted as a model , since it will make it possible to expedite the compensation of victims , be they private individuals or public authorities .
Everyone must play their own part .
The Commission , which , for once , has not followed the lead of the Americans even though it might have been beneficial in this case , should establish a basis for maritime safety at the earliest possible opportunity .
Let me remind you that the Erika was registered in Valletta .
The most effective form of prevention is to ensure that any potential polluter is made liable to extremely heavy financial penalties .
Katiforis report ( A5-0017 / 2000 )
We agree that the fishing industry has the most to gain from promoting respect for the marine environment .
It is worth emphasising , however , that small-scale coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing activity can be combined with sustainable development that does not threaten the marine environment .
We feel that it is possible to create a fisheries management policy based on conserving the marine environment which is compatible with the interests of fishing communities .
But in order for this to happen , we must specifically take account of the fact that there is a correlation between income from fishing and an increase in fishing effort .
Hence the importance of our amendments , which sought to achieve this .
Effectiveness and excessive regulation are not compatible .
As regards reducing the pressure exerted by fishing upon resources , it is important to emphasise the international nature of this obligation .
What real point would there be in reducing our European fishing fleet if , at the same time , third countries were going to continue to deplete fisheries resources ?
Moreover , it must be observed that the development of the globalisation of trade has the effect of considerably reducing the effectiveness of inspection and supervision of fishing activities .
The latter occurs very frequently in businesses whose capital came from a Member State other than the flag State of the fishing vessel ( this is actually a way of concealing ' quota-hopping ' ) .
Food safety with regard to seafood is also of prime importance .
It is essential to safeguard the positive image of seafood products and to prevent unsafe food being sold in the European Union .
That concludes the vote .
Adjournment of the session
The session is adjourned .
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 2 March 2000 .
Madam President , this is actually about an event which has taken place since the last sitting , a hearing held by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities .
There was a grave danger of this House 's reputation being damaged .
You see , it emerged that during the plenary part-sessions there is a significant rise in prostitution in the area , in Strasbourg .
I would cordially request that you look into this matter with the Strasbourg authorities and investigate whether criminal activity is at work here , and whether it is linked to trafficking in women and forced prostitution .
Thank you , Mrs Gröner .
I would like to say that I was , like yourself , extremely shocked to hear this and immediately wrote to the Mayor of Strasbourg in order to get to the bottom of this issue .
I fully agree with your remarks and have even been proactive in responding to your wishes .
I will , of course , keep you updated on the reply that Mr Ries is bound to send me .
We get bad news in these points of order very often , but I have very good news for our Dutch colleagues .
They now have two television channels .
( Applause and laughter ) The Quaestors are working hard on their behalf and we are waiting for the Finnish television channel .
We have two German channels as well , so happy viewing everybody .
I hope you enjoy it .
I am absolutely delighted , Mrs Banotti , and think that the Members concerned should thank our Quaestors wholeheartedly .
Madam President , I would simply like to add to what Mrs Gröner has said .
You will be aware that terrible things happen to these women , that they are tortured and their families threatened . It is not only in Strasbourg that this happens .
I believe that we should all sit down and discuss this , that this Parliament should denounce this state of affairs and above all that it should play a full part in eradicating such modern-day slavery .
Thank you , Mrs Roure , for this additional information .
We will assess the situation when in Brussels too , and then see what should be done .
Madam President , on behalf of the entire Dutch contingent , I would like to extend warm thanks to Mrs Banotti for all the efforts she has made to ensure that we now have two Dutch television channels .
Madam President , I would like to talk about a quite different matter , which concerns Iran .
Thank you , Mr Jonckheer .
I will happily comply with your request .
Madam President , I do not think that Mrs Banotti should be cock-a-hoop today because she has laid on two Dutch TV channels .
It would have been better if she had obtained channels in all languages .
I hope we shall be getting a Danish channel next time .
Thank you , Mr Blak .
As you can see , Mrs Banotti , you still have your work cut out for you .
Madam President , I have learnt a new code of conduct here in the European Parliament , where one always has to express one ' s thanks .
I too would like to say thank you for the fact that here we can watch a Finnish television channel .
I hope that we will also be getting a picture on the Finnish language television channel and not just the sound .
Then I would like to say thank you for the fact that we have got cold water in the taps .
Back home we also have hot water , but at least it is good to have some water .
Thank you , Mr Seppänen .
Special European Council ( 23-24 March 2000 in Lisbon )
The next items are the Council and Commission statements on the Special European Council in Lisbon , which is to be held on 23 and 24 March .
It is my great pleasure to give the floor to the Prime Minster , António Guterres .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Antonio Guterres , and immediately give the floor to Mr Romano Prodi , President of the Commission .
Madam President , I would first of all like to extend my warmest congratulations to Prime Minister Guterres for his initiative for the Lisbon Summit , and congratulate him on the quality of the preparatory work .
We fully approve of the breakdown he presented to us , which received such an ovation , and we support his initiative .
Together , we can make the Lisbon Summit a success .
I will restrict myself in this speech to presenting the Commission ' s contribution to Lisbon - our long-term strategy and our vision for this Summit .
In Lisbon , very simply , we will have to decide whether Europe will be able to regain its leading role in the economic and technological worlds , relinquished long ago .
Now is the time to do this because there is currently a good chance of succeeding .
Never has this generation witnessed such a consensus of all the economic experts in Europe in forecasting strong and sustained growth .
Even the rise in oil prices did not cause an increase in inflation or halt this economic expansion , as might have been expected .
There are , nevertheless , a number of warning signs , but these are not of a nature to stop us proceeding with a development policy as we had intended and planned to do .
This will put us back in the lead , and this is why we adopted the e-Europe initiative , which prompted the Commission to set a practical example in its administrative reform .
This is an extremely complicated undertaking , but we will succeed because our mission is very clear , we are a relatively small institution and we have a very high level of culture .
By doing so , we want to set a clear example to all the European governments and all the administrations with which we will have to communicate by e-mail instead of on paper .
In addition to this , we are facing a social challenge : the need to fight unemployment and social exclusion .
We have been through a tough period , but I can assure you that there is nothing unrealistic in this goal .
Human resources mean education , training and reform of the Welfare State in order to deal , in particular , with the problem of an ageing society .
We have not always managed to find an adequate solution to this problem , which is affecting all our countries and becoming more serious every day .
And it is not going to go away .
I am confident that in Lisbon we will be able to take a step forwards , pooling benchmarking experiments and proposals on this major issue .
It is not true that we have achieved a perfect single market : there is still a great deal to do in this area .
If we want to halt inflation by raising oil prices , we must take action at both European and national levels to improve these services , and the same applies to financial and banking services .
We therefore need - and I am saying this because the slump has lasted quite a while now - a European company statute , a Community patent , a more liquid capital market and better procurement rules .
These are operational points which cannot be dismissed .
We at the Commission will do our part and , I repeat , we will introduce all these new technologies within the institution in all our procedures and relations with the outside world .
We must mobilise individual citizens , local authorities , national governments , businesses and trade unions .
As President Guterres said , the main goal of Lisbon will be to set up this network .
To achieve results , we need a new method , and , as the Portuguese Prime Minister said in his speech , clear macroeconomic parameters for this activity .
We are not introducing a new process : we are not adding anything new , but for the first time we are combining the existing processes and there is a chance this may bring success .
We must disseminate best practice in all fields and endeavour to advance it at European level .
We will achieve a great , strong , common Europe only if we are able , once again , to offer our citizens the joy of regaining our lost primacy .
On behalf of my group , I would like to congratulate Portugal , as the country holding the presidency , on organising the European Council in Lisbon , and we obviously wish you every success in your endeavours .
I would like to raise a few issues from our perspective .
The processes which have been put in place , by common agreement , to improve levels of employment , boost economic renewal and increase social cohesion within the territory of the Union are extremely important .
It is only right that the meeting in Lisbon at the end of the month should stop to consider where we are exactly .
Despite the diverse nature of these processes , they must have one common purpose : to improve people ' s quality of life in the Union .
We do not need new organisations , new working parties or new fora to achieve this objective , however .
The tools are surely known to all .
Often , however , national considerations , and sometimes ideological resistance also , mean that these tools do not get used .
When the idea of the single market was launched with some vigour in the 1980s , we could still move towards our destination at the speed of a local steam locomotive , figuratively speaking .
We must , however , be sure that the engine does not give out before the decision makers get to the finishing line .
How can we imagine being able to create the world ' s most competitive economic area unless we venture to free up competition within the area ?
The opening up of competition that has already been agreed for the telecommunications industry , as with the energy sector also , will create new , much-needed jobs and bring down prices for both industry and consumers .
A basis for all this is created through education and training , and research , however .
It is quite right to strive to create an information infrastructure quickly , which private individuals , schools and businesses can all as easily be a part of at reasonable or even no expense .
There are two issues that must be emphasised both by us and the Commission and the Council , and we must always draw attention to them .
These tasks are still mainly the responsibility of the Member States - whether it is the issue of education and training , and research , increased competition or removing barriers to entrepreneurship .
Coordination is natural in many sectors - within the framework of the tasks of the Union also - to avoid overlapping , but healthy , honest competition is still more important than coordination , including in many non-commercial sectors .
Benchmarking and best practice , which the Commission recommends , calls for a large measure of Europe-wide transparency in those fields where industrial secrecy does not apply .
The modernisation of the European social model and its increased effectiveness are as important for our competitiveness as the corresponding modernisation of the economy .
Work must be the most sensible way of improving the welfare of families , but if it really is not possible , we have in place society ' s safety net to prevent exclusion .
The most important issue , however , is developing mature interpersonal relationships in the family , at work , in society and in international relations .
As the importance of education is being stressed we have to make our youth aware of that early on in their development .
The Commission refers , appropriately in my opinion , to deficits that hinder the growth of employment in the Union .
We might mention the skills deficit as one example .
In a Union that has fifteen million unemployed there is now a shortage of labour to the tune of around one million workers in industries that are suffering from a skills deficit .
Some are suggesting importing a trained elite into the Union area .
I would ask whether this would be fair to countries less developed than ours , as this would create a brain drain for them .
The UN , on the other hand , has referred to the fact that in a few years ' time there will be a shortfall of 40 million workers as a result of demographic change .
Madam President , today 's debate is welcome , necessary and timely .
This is an affront to individual and collective dignity and it gives us at least 15 million reasons why we should carry on with the project that you have highlighted here today , Mr Prime Minister .
I too would like to welcome the fact that you have come to this House to dialogue with us before you go to your summit meeting .
That is a practical measure of the potential if we can get the policies and methods right .
The task of Lisbon has been correctly identified by you , Prime Minister , and by President Prodi as no less than shifting European policy towards a new practice , towards a new paradigm .
Through greater coherence in terms of bench-marking , sharing best practice and improving strategic cooperation and coordination , the EU can be an important factor in releasing a new economic dynamic .
Too many of our European markets are still too fragmented .
Not enough European small and medium-sized enterprises grow into world-beaters .
There are too few entrepreneurs in Europe .
There is too little enterprise in Europe .
You have remarked yourself , Prime Minister , that there is too little risk capital available on European capital markets .
We undertake too little research and development , individually as states and collectively as Europe .
Where we do , too little of it is converted into market product and services .
The Lisbon challenge is to delineate policy and methods for redressing these deficiencies and to release this potential dynamic .
This truly would be an enabling exercise .
If we can give people jobs this will prove to be the greatest weapon in the fight against social exclusion .
Mr Barón Crespo has described it as a Social Democrat project .
I am moved to describe it myself rather as an enlightened Liberal project .
Within the constraints of the budget and of sound macro-economic policy - I underline those as President Prodi has already done - strictly speaking our European social models offer a welfare safety net .
But for too many of the excluded and the long-term unemployed , the young , women and other marginalised groups , passive welfare dependency is not enough . It is a trap .
What we have to do is release this new dynamic at individual level by saying the resources are there , even within the framework of sound finance .
But they are used in a passive way .
We can best guarantee the fight against unemployment and encourage social cohesion in Europe through having an employment-rich economy and through having sustainable models of welfare .
Finally , on the knowledge society , it is very clear that we need to convert our thinking , not just at a technological but also at a social level .
It is very clear that we need to convert old social spending methods into new economic and social opportunity .
We need to shake off the policies and methods that have condemned a generation of Europeans to be second-best on the world stage .
We can do that by enabling Europe and its peoples to achieve our full potential .
If Lisbon can meet the targets spoken of here today , it will be an important step on that road to releasing the dynamic to which I have referred .
We would like to believe this , but we cannot .
Why ?
We know that new technologies do not , in themselves , generate greater democracy , but simply greater collective and personal autonomy for those citizens who are better integrated into mainstream society .
We know that the privatisation of public services poses a threat to social , regional and local cohesion , and we also know that the Commission is proposing to accelerate this process .
Lastly , we know that anyone who claims to meet the needs of the citizens must first ensure their total involvement in public policy decisions .
We know all of this .
We have heard nothing about the possibility of public funds being freed up to promote innovation in the field of products and services liable to improve the quality of life for all .
We have heard nothing about the universal telecommunications service being redefined in order to make it possible for everyone to access the Internet under the best possible technical conditions and at affordable rates .
In short , we have heard nothing to suggest that the citizen will be anything more than a customer .
We have heard nothing to suggest that opting for sustainable development would be a guiding factor in long-awaited growth .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office and Prime Minister of Portugal , the current situation in the Union and in most of the Member States is bound to raise legitimate concerns , in spite of the overall economic recovery .
The rate of unemployment has stayed relatively high , long-term unemployment is growing steadily worse and levels of employment are extremely low .
To add to this , there is an increasing lack of job security which makes matters even worse .
All this reflects a social situation in which women and young people are being particularly badly hit , and which is dramatically highlighted by the approximately 50 million people excluded from society .
It is our opinion that it is not only necessary to change this state of affairs , but that it is also possible to do so .
It is necessary because employment , and I mean quality employment with employee rights , is a fundamental right of every human being .
It is possible if we attack the real causes , which we feel are inseparable from the drift towards neo-liberalism , which has been shaping underlying trends , specifically in the macroeconomic field .
We are therefore now witnessing a clear consolidation of the basic core of Thatcherite tendencies , even if they are attenuated by aid measures .
An appeal for the coordination of social policies or an insistence on a society based on innovation and knowledge or on information technology will therefore not be enough , however important they may be .
It is crucial for us to abandon this monetarist and anti-social approach and put humans at the heart of our priorities and policies .
My Group , which attaches particular importance to social issues , met in Lisbon last week in view of the forthcoming Special Council , precisely in order to examine and discuss this issue .
We had an opportunity to listen to and hold discussions with workers ' representatives and with union leaders from Portugal and other parts of Europe .
In particular , we met representatives from ABB , from Michelin and also the organisers of job marches .
We reached joint conclusions on 14 points , of which we will officially inform the Presidency .
We will examine and judge the results of the Lisbon Summit in the light of these factors and in the light of our ability to establish concrete , properly quantified and timetabled objectives in this key area .
But we must surely oppose some of your policies , some of your principles , and a certain economic fundamentalism .
You declare yourselves to be concerned at the fate of the millions of poor and unemployed whose situation your policies have in fact done much to create .
Unfortunately , nothing is changing and nothing is going to change .
I must at this point stress our conviction that there can be no social policy nor full employment policy without national and European preferences , and without protecting our markets from fierce international competition .
It is our obligation to put Europeans first when it comes to employment , social protection , policies relating to the family , and retirement policy .
Your globalisation of the economy is neither necessary nor inevitable .
You are thus acting as accomplices in this process .
You are facilitating it , collaborating with it , and are in fact orchestrating , despite your declared intentions , the disintegration of our social welfare systems , precariousness , and social decline .
Your ultra-liberal headlong rush is thus surely not the solution to social problems , precariousness or employment problems faced by tens of millions of European citizens .
Mr President , the Lisbon Summit will produce a further string of fine words to dazzle us with .
The words will be welcome , but the basic problem is that we have an Economic and Monetary Union which attaches more importance to fighting inflation than to promoting employment .
The Central Bank has said that price rises should always be kept below 2 % .
The Stability Pact says that the budget deficit must be no more than 1 % in ordinary years .
There is no requirement that unemployment should be below 5 % or - better still - below 2 or 1 % .
It is public consumption and the price of money which definitely must not rise .
You might think that a country would wish to limit unemployment by means of public investment , but that is prohibited .
It is more important to stick to the holy cow of monetary policy than to find jobs for the unemployed .
I , on the other hand , think it is more important to take account of families ' finances and to ensure that dad comes home with a wage packet instead of a redundancy notice .
So too did the Danish Government which came to power in 1993 .
In 1992 we had 9.2 % unemployment , both in Denmark and in the eleven countries of the good old EU .
Between 1992 and 1998 , unemployment in Denmark fell to 5.1 % .
In the EU , it increased to 10.9 % .
In Denmark , we have had combined growth of 20 % , compared with 10 % in the EU .
If the Danish Government had acted in the same way under the present dispensation , it would have been downright illegal and unconstitutional because the budget deficit was 3.9 % at that time .
Now , Denmark also has an actual budget surplus because those who exchanged their redundancy notices for wage packets also began to pay tax instead of drawing benefit .
I believe that the EU ' s prime ministers ought to study the Danish example when they meet for their tête-à-tête on the economy in Lisbon .
We need a change to the EMU Treaty instead of a further string of fine words directed at the unemployed .
My group hopes that Danish voters will decide to keep the Danish krone when they take part in the referendum on membership of EMU on 28 September of this year .
Mr President-in-Office , I listened to your speech with great interest and it is obvious that in overall terms , no one here today could fail to agree with what you have said .
You have made statements of intent , which correspond to the vision we all share of the problems of jobs and of Europe in general .
From this point of view , we must also think about one of the objectives for the Lisbon Summit that you mentioned , namely combating the political deficit in Europe .
My first question , which is a very direct one , is about an institutional issue which we now have the opportunity to discuss with you for the first time as President-in-Office of the European Council .
This concerns the most serious political problem we have had to face in recent times - the problem of Austria .
The question that I would like to ask very clearly is this : are you representing 14 EU countries here or 15 ?
This is a perfectly sensible question because as President-in-Office of the European Union , you have worked and acted as the spokesperson for bilateral decisions between states .
From this point of view , this question is perfectly sensible and requires the clearest possible answer .
That is my first question .
My second question is about the Employment Summit .
No one understands better than us the crucial role that the Internet , the digital economy and the knowledge-based economy have to play , but these issues were not what the Employment Summit was originally intended for .
Mr President-in-Office , you concluded on a vaguely ideological note , which is fair enough .
This is what we must counter if we are to guarantee the knowledge-based economy of the future .
Furthermore , the way in which this European Council is being prepared is a good illustration of this .
Firstly , there is the seriousness and depth of the document presented in January .
Then , there are the various preparatory conferences and the contributions that both business and union leaders are making towards this summit .
In particular , there is the latest contribution to research that was made at the recent meeting which brought together Nobel Prize winners and Ministers for Science and Technology .
This shows that the Portuguese Government is preparing for this Summit seriously and is paying a great deal of attention to its substance .
For years , many people have said this was impossible , that in modern society it would never again be possible .
Something that we said here in January and that I would like to repeat is that we must not be satisfied with this strategic objective being the priority of one presidency , a priority for just six months .
Only in this way will it be able to match the degree of seriousness with which the presidency is preparing this Special Summit .
I congratulate you , Mr President-in-Office .
It is an agenda which emphasises that it is a strong and dynamic economy and increased competitiveness which will secure the objective of higher employment in the EU .
The fact that the EU lags so far behind the United States with regard to research , job creation and the development of new technology gives pause for thought .
It is right to focus upon access to , and use of , the Internet by public officials and by the education system and to create what has been called " the learning society " .
It is also only right to concentrate upon access to venture capital and otherwise to reinforce the position of small and medium-sized businesses .
In its discussion paper for the Summit , the Commission set quantified objectives for developments in the field of employment , including women ' s employment , and for the fight against unemployment .
In the same paper , the Commission also set the objective of mitigating the problems connected with poverty in Europe over the next ten years .
With the exchange of experiences and ideas as part of the Luxembourg process , employment policy is designed in such a way as to ensure that this will , in fact , be the case .
However , it is also very important that countries should not work at cross purposes when solving the social problems in question but , on the contrary , that they should cooperate and provide each other with inspiration .
You pointed out that there are fifteen different public opinions , but , in fact , there are many more than that .
There are , after all , huge differences within the Member States .
Coming from Belgium , I do not need to point out that there is a difference of opinion between Flanders and Wallonia , or between former East and West Germany ?
Furthermore , our public opinion threatens to become polarised as a result of globalisation .
Where there used to be a discrepancy between the haves and the have-nots , there are now those who can keep up as opposed to those who cannot or those who drop out of society .
This is a very serious risk .
In Europe , everyone should be able to keep up .
Every region should be able to keep up and everyone must be able to take part in the knowledge-based society .
We have had to establish that , despite the many investments being made in structural funds , the unemployment figures still vary greatly .
I would therefore advocate networking regions , more so than a Europe in which each Member State stands on its own dignity .
Mr President , Mr Guterres , Mr Prodi , ladies and gentlemen , it is pleasing to hear the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency declaring full employment to be an aim of European policy .
I agree that this should be so , but to be successful in the future a model of full employment requires , above all , professional and socially secure jobs .
We need to structure the economy and the world of work in such a way that gainful employment becomes worthwhile .
You are relying mainly on further deregulation in the internal market , on the Internet revolution and on e-commerce and e-business to be job machines .
This policy will not allow you to keep your promise of full employment .
Economic reforms such as the liberalisation of the internal energy market have led to stiff competition and numerous mergers .
This has cost jobs and the trend is continuing .
As early as the mid-nineties , Mr Bangemann promised a huge increase in jobs due to the information society .
The result is sobering .
When I see that many companies engaged in e-commerce admittedly have huge market capitalisation , but that their actual business is constantly making losses , this does not necessarily make me feel any more optimistic .
E-commerce and e-business certainly have a great future .
But their contribution to employment growth is overstated almost religiously by their proponents .
That is why I believe that we need a different policy mix for a new policy of full employment .
Secondly , it means a strategy to make drastic cuts in working time and redistribute work between men and women .
Thirdly , it means more state support for employment in ecologically sound sectors of the economy and a suitably future-oriented innovation policy linked in particular to boosting small and medium-sized enterprises .
Fourthly , this is about an emancipatory labour market policy .
If we do not go down this path then we will undermine our future prosperity , our competitiveness , our economic productivity and the social cohesion of society .
Mr President , the European leaders will be primarily addressing three key issues when they meet in Portugal later this month .
Firstly , they will examine how best the European Union should equip itself to accommodate the broader effects of trade globalisation .
Secondly , a closer examination will take place as to what initiatives should be implemented to avoid and combat social exclusion in our society .
Thirdly , the leaders will bring forward new programmes to guarantee that the European Union is a leader across all elements of the changing and evolving information technology markets .
The world is becoming a smaller place in terms of market access and the term " global village " is not out of place .
However , the arrival of globalisation will not and must not mean absolute and free market access for all products and services operating at this time .
It is clear that each country has different priorities in terms of the different economic sectors it wishes to protect .
That is clear from the completed Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and will be evident in the World Trade Organisation talks which will be taking place over the next three years .
Moreover , initiatives to promote cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe must continue to receive support .
We must not build a Europe of the haves and the have-nots .
The European Union as an economic entity is very strong but there are still large-scale social problems which need to be addressed in a structured manner .
We must continue to put in place comprehensive training programmes for the youth and long-term unemployed in both urban and rural areas within Europe .
The European Social Fund and national governments must continue to finance drug rehabilitation programmes , to promote higher standards of adult literacy and to work against early school-leaving .
Mr President , a well-functioning labour market which strikes a sustainable balance between supply and demand is a widely cherished desire .
It is therefore understandable that long-term , high unemployment within the European Union is high on the agenda of the European Summit in Lisbon .
But it is questionable whether it is justified to elevate employment policy to European policy in this way .
Despite satisfactory economic growth , the drop in unemployment is stagnating .
A number of Member States with high economic growth are facing an overstrained labour market and rising inflation .
Other Member States are experiencing limited growth , widespread unemployment and fixed prices .
Specific instruments , such as interest rates and the exchange rate , are no longer at our disposal .
The fact that Member States are at different stages within the economic cycle nonetheless requires measures specific to each Member State .
Is the Council acting upon this ?
And if so , what measures does the Council Presidency have in mind ?
No one is expecting labour-intensive industries to flourish within an overstrained labour market .
But is this reflected in the policy ?
Has a decision been made in favour of selective growth in such policy ?
And are people prepared to allow the areas suffering high unemployment to benefit from this growth in labour-intensive industries ?
If the Lisbon Summit is serious about fighting unemployment , then we will need more than generic measures .
It is important to take the work where unemployment is at its highest .
It is a gamble to expect that the unemployed will go where the work is , especially in the case of cross-border labour migration .
This may result in the further depopulation of certain disadvantaged areas .
Mr President , with the launch of the common currency , we have not made life any easier for ourselves by abandoning monetary , economic instruments specific to Member States in order to control the economic cycle .
I can imagine that Great Britain , Sweden and Denmark will think twice before embarking on the euro adventure .
Mr President , I would like to extend warm thanks to Prime Minister Guterres for his account and the clarity of this account .
My main question relating to this is , what is actually new ?
Of course , we have in place macro-economic cooperation , the so-called Cologne process , and we have a process for employment , the Luxembourg process . What will this Summit actually add to this ?
What is new , of course , is social protection .
This , in fact , has hardly been dealt with at Summit level and is , in my opinion , a very important topic of discussion .
I think that it is easy to identify the lessons which can be drawn from the Luxembourg process and to declare them applicable to social protection .
I do wonder why public health cannot be mentioned in this respect .
Mr Barón has caused me some concern by saying that the programme which your are presenting , Mr President , is in fact a socio-democratic programme .
It is , of course , a fact that a sound macro-economic policy will automatically result in an improvement in the employment situation .
We have experienced this . But on the other hand , the sound rule of macro-economics should not be misused by pinning it down too much .
Indeed , you will then end up in a situation which a great many economies under socio-economic and socio-democratic rule have experienced - and are still experiencing - where eventually , employment becomes the victim of bad macro-economic policy .
This should not happen .
Finally , Mr President , I have a problem with the Portuguese Presidency ' s documents and also to some extent , but less so , with the Commission ' s documents .
It is their defensive nature .
We have a few countries in Europe , including Denmark , the Netherlands and Ireland , which rivalled the United States in terms of sound performance in the field of employment .
So it is possible for Europeans to match this .
There are other countries which appeared far less capable of doing this .
It is then far more sensible to find out why some countries or regions are doing so very badly , rather than saying that we are underperforming compared to the United States .
Mr President , I should like to thank Prime Minister Guterres for his very committed speech .
I too regard globalisation and the rapid changes that are under way as the major challenges , and I also think that they will only succeed if the people of the countries concerned are involved .
I was therefore very pleased with the Commission ' s document for the Lisbon Summit with its two main messages .
The main message is that the individual should be at the centre of the EU ' s policies .
We have our own approach in Denmark , as Jens-Peter Bonde emphasised , and other countries have theirs , as has also been mentioned .
What is crucial is that the individual Member States and the EU should respect the fact that there can be different methods of solving the problems concerned .
Another reason why I am saying this is that we ought to have something on the agenda in addition to comparisons with the United States .
We must never for a moment forget that our greatest task in Europe is a healing one . By that I mean we must not lose sight of the development perspective .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am particularly concerned about the information and knowledge society which is supposed to be promoted during the Portuguese Presidency .
To achieve that , we first need an initiative to redistribute work by radically cutting working time and sharing out the work of reproduction differently .
These proposals are not new but they are becoming more topical .
Why ?
Because so far the debate on the information society has completely ignored the fact that only an elite with good technical training benefits from it !
To prevent a repeat of the promise of prosperity for all thanks to technology , but without any change to social structures , we need a debate on power and the distribution of resources .
Or have industrialisation , nuclear power and biotechnology led to greater justice in the past ?
One important point is unfortunately missing completely from the debate , despite the fact that this House is otherwise so fond of consumer protection and mentions it so often .
The right to data protection does not appear in the Euro Paper nor is it part of the current debate on e-commerce .
I wonder what has happened to it !
Or has the evidence recently supplied of the ' Echelon ' global bugging system already been forgotten ?
If we wish to remain credible in developing a European Charter of Fundamental Rights then the fundamental right to privacy must of course be included in each of our individual programmes , in particular where new technologies are concerned .
Mr President , I think it is extremely commendable that the Portuguese programme places such emphasis upon combating unemployment and that the objective is to banish all unemployment .
Nonetheless , there remains an imbalance in the programme about which I am concerned and which I want to talk about .
Education is to be put in order , a fiscal policy devised and venture capital arranged .
In fact , everything possible is to be done to provide the innovators with everything on a plate .
My own experience of these industries , however , is that they are managing really rather well .
In many cases , they have far too much capital , and in many cases they are spoiled .
I have seen IT companies which are unbelievably spoiled .
I think that resources should instead be invested in trying to prevent a split in society , a division of society into two sectors : the new economy and the old .
Above all , integration mechanisms should be created .
Mr President , the agenda for the Lisbon Council , which is to be held on 23 and 24 Match , is liable to induce dizziness .
It is not surprising , given all this , that the numerous contributions made by the presidency of the Commission and by the Member States tend , for the moment , to be spread too thin .
Reading the preparatory documents gives rise to certain fears in this regard .
But how can we guarantee greater convergence of all these vastly different processes ?
The conclusion of the document issued by the presidency on 12 January holds the key .
It would appear that here one should take the word ' framework ' as having the dual meaning of ' synthesis ' and ' obligation ' .
Mr President , are we not , with these blanket documents , going down the path of reinventing the broad strategic guidelines ?
If we consider our gross national product , that ought actually to be possible .
We now need to ask ourselves why this is the case .
Of course there are sectors of the business world , including the new media , in which we occupy leading positions .
Here I need only mention mobile telephones .
We have banned them here in the Chamber , rightly , because they are instruments of torment .
At the same time , however , they also make life much easier for many people because they create jobs .
And in Europe we are world leaders in this field .
Why ?
We are world leaders because we managed to adopt a common set of European rules ; early on we decided on a common European standard which today has become a world standard .
This means that if we in Europe get our act together in good time then we will also be competitive in this field of new technologies .
Where then do Europe 's shortcomings actually lie ?
I believe , Mr President-in-Office , that we cannot eliminate the shortcomings by setting up more observatories as is planned at present .
I believe that these observatories create a handful of jobs for officials , but that they do not create any jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises .
We in Europe are deficient where training is concerned .
This is shown by the fact that where the new media are concerned we are having to import from countries outside Europe .
Europe lacks , as has already been stated , entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial spirit .
There are too few young people who are willing to take the risk of being self-employed .
The way in which we structure our work and the way in which work is organised is not flexible enough .
In Europe we are also still a long way from a common domestic market .
We have 15 domestic markets and a common European internal market .
For electronic commerce we need common , clear , European rules .
We need a European patent at a reasonable price ; we do not have that yet either .
This European patent is so expensive that it is not competitive with other patents .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Gutíerrez for his speech tonight and also for his Lisbon initiative , which is very important to us .
We have a lot of Europeans in the gallery here with us this evening and I wonder what they make of our discussion here this evening .
There are many challenges involved with creating that full employment .
This is the great challenge , the great importance of Lisbon .
I just want to dwell on one or two key aspects that will help us realise that goal of turning rhetoric into reality .
That really is a brave decision , because some Member States will clearly find themselves towards the bottom of the league table , which is something nobody likes .
There are other areas that we must look at .
One of these is the challenge of creating an e-Europe which involves all its citizens and does not leave anybody on the wayside .
Another is the process of actually having a genuine single market - which we still do not yet have - and skills training that will be the key to delivering that innovative and knowledge-driven society .
I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area .
Who could challenge such an ambition ?
I have to say , however , that dynamism and entrepreneurship as well as social cohesion are a very ambitious target , not to mention the creative tension between those two objectives .
I hope that we will achieve them , but I sound a warning note .
I note another ambitious objective of playing a proactive role in organising cyberspace .
I cannot help thinking this is more a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted !
I welcome the emphasis on bolstering research and development in Europe , on developing content industries and on speeding up broad-band networks with all that is involved as part of working towards a knowledge society .
Actually , I would prefer to call it an information economy because it is the economy aspect which is the most important .
We live in the time of IDEA - the Internet digital electronic age .
That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side , the electronic side , of life .
But I welcome the fact that this summit is aiming also at a wider emphasis on reforms of our economies in Europe to improve competitiveness and innovation .
That must be right .
We cannot just focus on the new economy .
We must pay attention to the old .
I look forward to hearing more detail about the European Charter for micro-enterprises - that should be very interesting when it comes forward .
One of the priorities which has been identified under the Cardiff process is to improve the sensitivity of the financial markets to the value of intangible investments and investments in knowledge .
That has been achieved possibly beyond the wildest dreams of people a few months ago .
It can be seen in the phenomenal growth in the stock markets of Europe in the value of dot.com companies and just recently in the major changes in the composition of the FTSE 100 index in London .
I cannot help thinking however that although these values have gone sky high and we may expect the bubble to burst , nevertheless the underlying structural change in our economies is here to stay .
Mr President-in-Office , you have made us in the European Parliament eager to leave for Lisbon already .
All of us can only hope that the Special Summit is able to live up to the high expectations which people have of it .
That is also why you have rightly drawn together employment , economic reform , growth and social cohesion and made them issues for top-level action .
It is important for all players in the governments and in the Commission to be pulling in the same direction towards full employment .
Then it will also be possible to convince all economic policy-makers of the need to conform to agreed behaviour , which so far they unfortunately still have not yet done .
Europe need lament neither over the success of the US economy nor over the strong dollar if it does not learn any lessons for itself from it .
Reforms of financial services , services capital and labour markets are certainly useful and necessary .
But they alone will not give growth the stimulus it needs to enable long-lasting growth , effectively generating jobs , to be organised at a high level .
We were forced to experience this several times in the nineties .
An average productivity increase of 2 % requires a growth rate of 3.5 % for full employment to be able to be achieved within ten years .
This scenario has moved into the foreseeable future .
That is why full employment actually needs to be right at the top of the agenda .
We need to set a growth target of at least 3 % .
The aim of full employment cannot be achieved by economic policy alone .
The Europe of innovation and the information society also need to be commandeered to reach this target .
We are a long way from it today .
We must also recognise that we need another type of economic and financial policy .
It is simply unacceptable for shareholders or directors of plcs to be the only ones who decide on jobs , the economy and share prices .
When 13-year-old school children play on the computer after school at restructuring their parents ' share portfolios , then this has more to do with toy casinos than with responsibility .
I think that the Special Summit in Lisbon will herald responsible economic planning in the European Union .
Mr President , Prime Minister , President of the Commission , the Portuguese Presidency has presented an ambitious programme for the Special Summit .
Congratulations !
I also welcome the support which Portugal is receiving from the Commission , not least through the communication which seeks to develop the Community into an information society for everyone .
In adopting the Luxembourg Process the Heads of State and Government achieved tangible successes .
Since 1997 , however , the really significant results have failed to materialise .
So far , the Cologne Employment Pact has not been able to be invested with sufficient content .
In addition , the macroeconomic dialogue lacks the participation of the European Parliament as an equal partner .
In information technology , in particular , some European countries lack qualified workers , as Mr Suominen emphasised .
Rather than ' importing ' them from third countries , it is better to invest accordingly in vocational training and further education , to invest in human capital .
This is the most effective way of reducing unemployment .
The most important objective of the Summit must be achieved as quickly as possible , and that is to improve the competitiveness of the European economy .
In this context the Ciampi Group also mentions the European company statute .
It puts the loss to the economy of not having a statute of this kind at EUR 30 billion a year .
We do not want the basic unrefined European company model .
We need this European company to come supplied with minimum standards of worker participation .
Our social policy goal is not of course the basic unrefined model of the market economy either , but a social market economy built on the European model .
We should also judge the success of the Lisbon Summit on the contribution it makes to achieving this goal .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , do you know how Archimedes expounded his theory of the lever ?
He would say , ' Give me a fulcrum and I will lift the world . '
In Lisbon you will clearly be trying to lift the world or , in any case , our world , the world of Europe .
As for the lever , you have described all the appropriate mechanisms in your exhilarating proposal , which is exciting in so many respects .
That simply leaves the fulcrum .
The fulcrum is provided by resources .
Nevertheless , you will have to have the means at your disposal , means which , I fear , you are somewhat lacking at present .
It is thus up to you to create them . The straitjacket of Agenda 2000 will not provide you with the requisite means .
You will thus have to encourage your colleagues to see to it that the proposals you make to us are going to be financed .
Just one example - and it is one of the mechanisms central to your proposals - is that of the information and knowledge society .
It is clear - and you explained this very well - that the social divide is a fundamental problem that we must eradicate .
There is no need to add to this what I will call the digital divide .
Indeed , to whom will you offer this information and knowledge society ?
To an increasingly aged or ageing population , to a population which , despite everything , is still poor , and to a population which is becoming , alas , less and less well educated .
You will thus have to adopt a bottom-up approach if you do not want this knowledge society to amount to little more than the pursuit of profits by a number of successful and necessary new firms .
This is not your objective .
Unfortunately , there is one component missing from the mechanism that you have envisaged .
I refer to the public services . The public services have played a key role throughout the entire existence of our European social model .
But we cannot stop there .
We must now define more clearly , within the context of competition and the information society , the principal public service roles of tomorrow as applicable to public undertakings and to private companies in this sector .
Lastly , this knowledge society hinges on research and development and I would like to applaud , at this juncture , the Commission initiative that aims to create a European research area .
Mr President , the Commission and Parliament will nevertheless have need of the Council in order to secure the requisite resources to create this European research area .
The framework programme will not suffice , it will have to be boosted , and its broad guidelines modified .
This is a major task , but we are relying on you to see it through .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , you have spoken , Mr President , of a political deficit .
They are a tool for political decision making .
And yet they incorporate institutional measures whose influence we will be able to assess in the medium term .
They will bolster the role of the European Council in the decision-making process .
What we are doing here has certain implications .
Let us assess its impact on the set of decisions that we will take when we have to discuss the reform of the General Affairs Council .
It is up to each and every one of us to work on this .
Lastly , a final word on social cohesion .
I am pleased to hear you stress this , since we do not want a society which swaps innovation for social cohesion .
But we do not feel that social exclusion can be eradicated in a piecemeal fashion .
It is a global project , and while the notion of target groups may constitute a staging point , it cannot provide a solution to all our problems in terms of poverty and social exclusion .
We know that this requires a proactive approach and that we can count on your determination .
We will offer you our support in Lisbon in laying down new guidelines for the European Union ' s economic policy .
Mr President , along with my colleagues , I would like to welcome the very clear document that the Portuguese Presidency has given us today .
But it is not just the risk-takers who need to be encouraged .
It is everybody who is in a job working in an organisation .
One of the keys to mobilising this type of risk-taking is to move towards such full employment that people feel they can take that personal risk .
However , I would conclude by asking : which is going to come first ?
Can we really achieve that full employment without unleashing that entrepreneurial talent ?
If we wait for that to happen , I fear the great objectives you have set before us will not be achieved .
But if Lisbon wants to become the summit of these political ambitions , it must also take on board methodology .
I would like to draw your attention to three points , in particular , which seem essential to me if this summit wants to succeed as a major social summit .
Firstly , the method should be such that the employment strategy and the new coordination procedure for social security do not become subservient to a macro-economic policy whose only aim is stability .
Secondly , I would very much like to second your commitment to lay down clear objectives , regarding both economic growth and the level of employment .
But I would like to add that , if Lisbon wants to become a real social summit , we must also be able to spell out our plans to modernise and reinforce social security .
Here , too , we need standards of excellence and a Luxembourg process .
Finally , I support the European Commission ' s intent to formulate an ambitious European poverty standard and to drastically reduce poverty within a ten-year period .
I wish the President-in-Office all the best in the pursuit of his ambitions .
Mr President , there is an idea in the Portuguese Presidency 's statement which I like very much .
If that is the case , Mr President-in-Office , then we urgently need common objectives .
We need firm targets , the attainment of which it is possible to measure , in terms of both quality and quantity , for increasing employment rates , as for example was also recently proposed by the Commission .
We need firm , joint , realistic targets for reducing the unemployment rate , as for example was also recently proposed by the Commission , to 4 % in 2010 .
No longer must it be acceptable for the ECOFIN ministers to allow each other to celebrate consolidation successes at home while responsibility for the massive unemployment in Europe remains shrouded in mystery .
That would give you another ally for your policy .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , it is gratifying and encouraging to hear this House speak of a new strategic objective for the next decade .
The central role of employment and social policy , in the creation of this new society , is based on two factors .
On the one hand we have economic efficiency , since , in this new technological context , the quality of human resources is essential .
On the other hand , we have social equality , because , despite the economic upturn which we are witnessing , we still have an enormous degree of social inequality .
Europe needs to achieve full employment .
This full employment should be adapted to the society taking shape , with greater possibilities for its men and women .
European citizens must believe in this project and this state of affairs . They must not see it as something abstract which we only speak about in Brussels or Strasbourg .
We are asking right now for a transition to a new society , to an economy based on innovation , and on the information and knowledge-based society .
We must learn quickly , create new practices more suited to the new society and invest in technological change , but we must never forget the people or the institutions .
Lastly , we have to promote the integration of general equal opportunities policies for all men and women , with particular stress on aspects which help to reconcile professional life with family life .
All of this has to be done thinking of the European citizen . It has to be done thinking of the men and women who live and work daily in our countries .
The Special Lisbon Summit must fundamentally reaffirm , for the European citizen , the notion that the European Union still believes in the idea of a society which favours inclusion and social cohesion .
We must also look at the case of Japan because it holds lessons for Europe in terms of the organisation of work and the role of the state , of businesses and of the workers themselves in business objectives .
The fact is that Europe needs to have 32 million more people in work if it is to match the United States ' employment rate .
We also need new qualifications , as we know that access to technology does not necessarily guarantee high-quality jobs and entrepreneurial initiative .
We need a greater sense of responsibility and greater participation from our social partners - new actors , as the Pintassilgo report calls them - so that we can implement employment agreements and achieve competitiveness in business .
We need to solve the problems of poverty and we need a social model which is suited to these new conditions .
Mr President-in-Office , your proposal is a very ambitious one , although we know that its implementation does not depend on you , but on the 15 Member States .
If I may refer to the Austrian situation , I would very much like that country to be one of the states which will be putting your proposal into practice .
If Austria does this , however , it will be lying to and duping the very people who voted for one of the parties in its government .
I hope that it does just that !
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , we often hear it said by our neighbours , at all levels of expertise or debate , that we live in a globalised world .
However , it is not so common to hear people speak of what Europe ' s role should be in this context of the information society , globalisation and technology .
It seems to me , Mr President , that this is probably the case because we Europeans see Europe as somewhat removed from our more immediate concerns and interests .
The prime concern of the European citizens , after health , is probably employment .
Within this concern , employment is linked to competitiveness .
We therefore have to re-establish conditions of full employment , employment adapted to the society which is taking shape , which we are all building .
This requires the creation of a dynamic of growth which guarantees , for the whole of the European Union , an average annual rate of growth of 3 % at least .
I therefore think it is necessary to stimulate a culture of dynamism and business initiative and a strengthening of social cohesion .
All of this is absolutely essential . We need technological change and institutional reform .
While it is necessary to learn more quickly from good practices , it is also necessary to create suitable new practices and be innovative in the field of political methodology .
Through policies and structural reform , at the service of the citizens , we will create a Europe which is closer to us and , of course , a Europe which is stronger .
Mr President , I would like to endorse all compliments for the Portuguese Presidency ' s ambitions with this special summit .
The intention to achieve actual coordination of the socio-economic policy across the board appeals to me a great deal .
I would like to draw your attention to three specific points .
The first point concerns corporate governance .
The Portuguese Presidency has put the social dimension of innovation very firmly on the agenda , but I think that this dimension is still too far removed from the intentions to promote new activity .
In my opinion , this social dimension should , in fact , be brought into this new European company , whether this is a large multinational or a small booming ICT company .
In this light , I would like to reopen the debate on corporate governance to discuss the wider concept of the company as stakeholders society , including the role of both sides of industry and all parties involved .
On the last page of the president ' s document , I noticed the intention to set up an observatory for industrial change .
Their cooperation in these activities should also be outlined .
Another point which I would like to touch upon briefly is tax coordination , as I do not think I have sufficient time for three points .
The presidency has mentioned the sensitive issue of company tax and has admitted that there is a considerable impasse in the Monti package regarding this issue .
So I would ask that this point be given due attention too .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , there has already been a great deal of discussion , and I hope that I will not repeat any of what has gone before .
I would , however , like to thank the Portuguese Presidency most heartily for the document presented and for the excellent address given by the President-in-Office of the Council .
As President Guterres reminded us , it is true that we do not intend to introduce new processes in Lisbon , but rather to combine those decided upon in Luxembourg , Cardiff and Cologne .
This is innovation , and not just structural , technological innovation but also innovation in the field of procedures and methods .
As Mr Van Lancker has already said , the " Social Affairs " Council must have the same status as the ECOFIN Council .
Social dialogue must then be consolidated as a fundamental means of reaching a consensus on the implementation of the necessary changes .
- ( PT ) Mr President-in-Office , I would like to congratulate you on having persuaded Europe that the modernisation of the economy and social cohesion are concepts that can be mutually compatible .
We therefore hope that this Lisbon Summit will help to change the present model of female employment .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am extremely grateful for the excellent and highly pertinent contributions you have made during this debate on the preparation for our Lisbon Special Summit .
I think that we needed to have this debate and we also needed to involve Parliament , because in my opinion Europe still lacks strategic direction .
In order to achieve this strategic direction , there must be an institutional alliance which transcends the natural differences of political opinion .
This alliance has in fact been given form in the excellent contribution that Romano Prodi ' s Commission has just made to the preparations for the Lisbon Summit with their paper .
The fact that Parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important .
My second example is this : a great deal has been said about the participation of women in the labour market and about equal opportunities for women and men in society in general .
Much has been said in today ' s debate about the fundamental concepts of modern life , such as globalisation , the knowledge society and the relationship between the old and new economies .
All these words and the ideas behind them can apply to both opportunities and threats .
The challenge before us is to turn threats into opportunities and particularly , to avoid at all costs turning opportunities into threats .
Obviously , in order to achieve this , there are two issues which are crucial in all areas .
This certainly holds true for globalisation , which permits greater growth in wealth , international trade and productivity .
This is in fact not the first time that a technological transition has changed the social model and the model of economic organisation .
At such times of profound change , problems , particularly those concerning employment in the old economy , have been resolved by turning to the new economy and its resources .
To give an example , in Europe we have a textile industry .
We must maintain a textile industry in Europe , but this will only happen if we are able to apply the technologies of the information and knowledge society .
Lastly , I would like to answer a question that I have been asked , which is whether I am speaking here on behalf of 15 or 14 countries .
The answer is simple : I am speaking on behalf of 15 countries .
One of the things that the Portuguese Presidency has guaranteed is Austria ' s full participation in the workings of all of the Union ' s institutions .
This does not prevent the Portuguese Government , and many other European governments , from being not so much in dispute with a particular country , as being engaged in a battle to preserve certain principles and values .
Strangely enough , these very principles and values existed even before political movements such as the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats .
I am talking about principles and values which come from the Enlightenment and which affirm the supremacy of reason .
Because , if modern societies have one enemy today , it is irrationality in political behaviour .
We could call this irrationality political populism , or excessive nationalism , or religious fundamentalism , or racism or xenophobia .
This is a key issue : unless these values are respected , we may have a healthy economy , we may have jobs , but there will be no Europe .
, Commission .
( IT ) Mr President , Prime Minister , just a few quick comments to close this debate , which has been lengthy but extremely important and constructive .
Firstly , we are not starting from scratch .
Anybody who may think that we have been too optimistic in this debate must understand that we are not starting from scratch .
Europe has the advantages of the single currency and the single market to build on .
Now then , we have to increase productivity in these areas sufficiently to sustain economic growth without inflation .
However , we must be careful .
We may be breaking this debate on Lisbon down into constituent parts , but we have a clear objective constantly in mind : we have to create the economic and social conditions needed for sustained growth .
We have already mentioned economic conditions - efficiency and productivity . We must also create the social conditions needed to prevent the disintegration of society due to income discrepancies , which is one of the greatest dangers .
I stress this because it needs to be borne in mind : the income discrepancies in Europe have widened recently .
This is a problem which will become irresolvable in the future , if it is not already .
Therefore , our responsibility is both economic and social .
In Lisbon , we will have to take some practical decisions .
With regard to this , I would just like to mention a specific point , given that a great many references have been made to the United States .
There was a great deal of public investment at Federal , State and local levels .
These were huge investments , and they were in modern infrastructures .
I warn you that here our direct , and I stress , direct commitment at public and the other different levels is to build telecommunications highways , the roads for these new vehicles to run on .
The market , private individuals and companies will build the vehicles , but it is our responsibility to build the new highways .
Our problem is therefore that of avoiding a crisis in peripheral economies , which does not mean centralisation , nor a centralised programme , but giving peripheral economies the same chances that we give centralised economies .
There is therefore a very clear strategy for Lisbon .
The problem is simple .
We cried on each other ' s shoulders for such a long time , but during this time the seeds of what we had sown with such sacrifice in the early days of Europe were preparing to bear fruit .
It is clear that , at this point , the three processes have to be combined .
Remember the European company : we have not yet reached unanimity over the European company , but hundreds of thousands of companies are demanding it .
You see , all the different pieces are coming together to give direction to Lisbon .
We are able to give it credibility precisely because the Portuguese Presidency has teased out the threads of unification and woven these together to form a tapestry .
Thank you very much , Mr President of the Commission , thank you very much , Mr President-in-Office , for your notable contributions to an interesting and important debate .
I have received six motions for resolutions , pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
The debate is closed .
( The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9. p.m. )
Before we resume the sitting I should like to make a comment which I always make at night sittings , but since faces change there are many people here who are not yet familiar with this .
I should like to request that you contribute to the sitting 's reaching a speedy conclusion by keeping to the speaking times .
There are three reasons for this .
The first is the old party rule : the later the evening , the more rowdy the guests .
That does not apply to the plenary . The second is that the people sitting behind the glass screens - the interpreters - also want to go home .
So please , keep to the speaking times and we will make good progress !
Environmental dimension in the development process
rapporteur .
( SV ) Mr President , ever since the Brundtland report of 1987 , it has been clear that a policy which emphasises only economic growth cannot be sustained in the longer term .
The challenge for us all consists in integrating social and environmental considerations .
In spite of the fact that this is a document of several hundred pages , it is a programme which , in general , is well put together .
If further progress is to be made towards the necessary level of integration , an appropriate method has to be developed .
Indicators also need to be selected so as to be able to keep abreast of what is under way in terms of developing know-how , pilot projects etc .
This type of work has been going on for many years in many of the OECD countries .
It could be given higher priority , but it is in fact under way .
Matters are organised rather less well in the majority of developing countries .
There , there is a lack of both knowledge and resources to facilitate the integration of environmental considerations , together with the preventive approach which is the very essence of the decisions taken in Rio .
In this context , aid can play an important role .
The proposed regulation we are discussing today is aimed at ensuring that , in providing aid , the EU fully and completely integrates the environmental dimension into its activities .
So far , there remains , however , a lot to be done in terms of developing methods .
In particular , knowledge and skills within both the Commission and the recipient countries must be increased .
I was responsible for the preparations for this second reading .
My work has , of course , been very much based upon experiences from the first reading and upon the preparatory work for that reading .
On that occasion , Parliament tabled a large number of amendments , of which approximately a third have been accepted by the Council ahead of this second reading .
Analysing the situation , I identified three or four principal points where I think we in Parliament ought to try to amend the Council proposal .
That does not mean that other questions raised at first reading are not important . What it does mean , however , is that we ought to concentrate on those which are most important .
We ought also , in the interests of reaching agreement with the Council , to see to it that we , as far as possible , relinquish what is of less importance .
This is something we ought to support , a fact which also emerges from Amendment No 11 .
Regarding the period of applicability of this regulation , I believe that there is no reason to commit ourselves now once and for all .
I think that the Council ' s proposal is acceptable because an evaluation will take place within four or five years .
This question will then , at all events , return to Parliament .
Finally , I want to mention a question on which there have been , and remain , a variety of views .
This concerns the committee procedure , that is to say how actual implementation of this regulation will look .
Where this is concerned , I take the view that we should try to get away from an arrangement whereby the Member States themselves are directly involved in determining the fine detail of implementation .
They should be involved , and determine the framework and rules , but leave it to the Commission to implement the actual project .
In this connection , we have proposed , in the course of the examination of this proposal , a so-called split comitology procedure , which could be used to excellent effect .
I hope that the vote will ensure that this will also become Parliament ' s proposal .
Might I just ask for one more thing ?
The fact is , we shall need further consultations .
I would therefore propose without further ado that the vote could take place on Wednesday .
It is now our task to counteract this .
In the industrialised countries , significant initiatives are being taken to preserve and protect the environment .
In the developing countries , however , intensive work still needs to be done on designing appropriate policies , strategies and projects to prevent further destruction and to care for the environment .
Measures need to be implemented which , for instance , take account of the consequences of developing countries being integrated into the global economy .
Nigeria can once again serve as an example here , as oil drilling there is causing commensurate environmental damage .
Here too , education and training measures need to be supported in order , in the end , to help people to help themselves .
The content of the regulation must therefore be supported in full , although the budget proposed by the Council is not sufficient by far .
Even at this early stage a considerable increase needs to be considered for when the Treaty or the regulation is revised .
These disasters are in fact the result of extreme climatic changes with which we should be quite familiar , since they are precipitated by human activities , notably those of developed countries .
The greenhouse effect and deforestation also have a considerable impact .
As regards this regulation on the environmental dimension in the development process in developing countries , the Council has broadly taken up the amendments that we presented and voted upon at first reading .
From this perspective we cannot fail to be satisfied .
No programme can be truly effective unless it is conducted in close collaboration with the communities concerned .
Mr President , the key to the development of the less developed countries is that they should have the chance themselves to participate in their own development programmes by identifying the problems themselves and seeking solutions to them .
The new paradigm for development cooperation stresses the notion of partnership , in which the so-called donor of aid is a consulting party .
It must allow scope for the countries concerned to determine for themselves what their problems are , and let them draw up a plan to improve the situation and find a solution themselves .
The most important task aid agencies have is to make themselves unnecessary , all the while ensuring that the work is leading to local action and prosperity .
My colleague , Mr Wijkman , has produced a good report in this respect , one that emphasises this paradigm that is the only successful and morally tenable one .
However , at present , this approach is being applied scandalously badly by the EU as far as scientific and technological projects are concerned .
The EU ' s framework programmes do not extend to developing countries .
In other words , our North African partners , for example , cannot become involved in scientific and technological projects concerning the environment .
Nothing is actually preventing them from doing research but there are simply no facilities for financing projects , as the developing countries do not have access to the consortia as a party applying for funds .
But why not ?
It has been made easier for Eastern Europe to participate .
The matter is even harder to appreciate , when we think of how much we are affected by the problems of desertification in North Africa and the problems that are associated with the Mediterranean area .
We must ensure that no project can be established without input from local researchers .
Mr President , the regulation on the table gives the European Union an instrument and the legal - but also the political - responsibility to ensure that the environmental dimension is integrated into development policy .
To do this , sufficient financial support is of course necessary .
That is why I , like one previous speaker already , advocate voting in favour of the rapporteur 's Amendment No 11 .
Since integrating the environmental dimension is a long-term commitment , I am in principle against limiting the duration of this regulation .
However , the arguments that excessively lengthy negotiations with the Council are putting existing projects - projects which are already up and running - at risk have persuaded me otherwise .
In the same way I support the rapporteur 's proposal on split comitology , whereby decisions on the strategic guidelines would be decided under a management procedure and those on implementation under an advisory procedure .
Hopefully we are reaching the conclusion of a process that started a year ago under the previous Parliament .
So for many of us this is an interesting learning experience .
The previous regulation expired at the end of 1999 .
Since the beginning of this year , the Commission has been unable to make any new financial commitments on these budget lines .
This places the Commission and Europe in an increasingly difficult situation .
Hence our desire to conclude the process of adoption in the near future .
In this context , we have supported the informal negotiations between the Council presidency and the parliamentary rapporteur so as to arrive at a proposal which could be accepted by both parties .
The main areas of difference have been on the financial reference amounts , on comitology and on the duration of the regulation .
I would like to comment briefly on each of these issues .
On the financial reference amount , briefly , we accept the compromise proposals put forward under Amendment No 11 .
Comitology :
In our view , the programme to be funded under the regulation does not represent substantial budgetary implications and hence does not merit a management procedure , an advisory procedure being more appropriate .
Hence the Commission supports , in principle , Amendment No 16 but prefers the wording of Amendments Nos 19 , 20 and 21 .
Concerning the duration of the regulation , our position has been to support an unlimited duration subject to periodic revision following evaluations .
However we are aware that if unlimited duration were to be approved here , this would lead inevitably to a conciliation process .
The final important issue common to both this regulation and the forest regulation are the amendments concerning bank guarantees .
We concur with the view of Parliament that the Commission should not place bureaucratic barriers to the access of some NGOs to financing from Community funds .
For this reason the Commission took a decision in July 1999 only to require bank guarantees for advance payments of over EUR 1 million .
Hence the problem has , to a large extent , been resolved .
Furthermore the Commission considers that such matters are best addressed in a horizontal manner rather than through specific regulations .
For these reasons the Commission does not support the proposed Amendment No 10 on bank guarantees .
Careful reading of the joint position will show that most of the concerns behind these amendments have been taken into consideration but following the structure of the regulation .
Amendment No 12 proposes the raising of the threshold for submission of projects for consideration by the Council from EUR 2 million to EUR 5 million .
Given that most projects are already under EUR 2 million this amendment is considered not relevant .
Furthermore we are concerned that its adoption would lead to a conciliation process .
Therefore the Commission does not support it .
The amendments on procurement and access to the markets - Amendments Nos 13 and 14 - would mean a departure from standard and carefully agreed formulations .
In any event , as with bank guarantees , the Commission does not consider it appropriate that such issues be addressed through special provisions in specific regulations but rather in a horizontal manner .
We oppose Amendment No 15 , concerning the creation of an environmental monitoring union , as this is in our opinion a question of internal Commission organisation which should not be addressed through a regulation .
Such a unit is , in fact , already operational although we intend to strengthen it further .
Lastly , we do not support Amendment No 17 as it does not conform to the usual rules or formulation of regulations and is considered to be redundant .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
If the rapporteur wishes the vote to be postponed I would ask him to request this at voting time .
Our services say that it is possible to do so then .
Conservation and sustainable forest management
The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A5-0043 / 2000 ) by Mr Bouwman , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism ...
( Mr Bouwman interrupted the President . )
Bouwman .
( DE ) Mr President , I think you are mistaken !
There is another report first .
I would be happy to speak now , but there is another report first .
President .
Thank you very much , Mr Bouwman . I knew right at the beginning of the debate that there was a reason why I was so pleased to see you here in the House .
Please forgive me . My files have got in rather a muddle .
That does happen from time to time in the hectic activity of the night sitting .
Forget what I have said so far .
We will start again .
Mr President , as Commissioner Nielson has already stated , this debate marks the inauguration of the new competences of the Committee on Development and Cooperation in the field of codecision .
This is the financial instrument by means of which the Union can fulfil the obligations arising from the Agreement on biodiversity , the Framework Agreement on climate change and the Agreement on the fight against desertification .
All these agreements indicate that developing countries must be supported in the search for solutions to the problem of their forest resources .
At first reading , Parliament approved a total of 34 amendments of which the Council , in its common position , has totally or partially taken up 18 .
Of the remaining 16 , some , and in particular Amendments Nos 5 and 6 , are no longer relevant following the interinstitutional agreement on the 2000 budget .
The debate and negotiations that we have held with the Council and the Commission have focused on three topics : the budget , dates and comitology .
Mr President , I should like to say that I agree with many of the points made in the report by the previous speaker and rapporteur , Mr Fernández Martín .
Above all , as with all budget lines , it is very important to discuss the funding these budget lines represent .
One point which is of really fundamental importance to me is made in various amendments - for example , Amendments Nos 2 and 4 - which emphasise the active participation of forest peoples and the indigenous population .
I believe that this is an absolutely fundamental point , especially when we are talking about the sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Martín , you have certainly described very clearly what your report is all about .
Thank you for that .
But we also all know only too well that not all projects are as successful as we would like them to be .
It is precisely here that there should be no cut in the Commission and the Council 's contributions , because that would almost certainly be counterproductive .
It is also very important for us now for the projects to be able to continue to run without interruption .
Otherwise we can only endorse Mr Fernández Martín 's report ; the comments made by Mrs Scheele and others are also a perfect reflection of our own thoughts .
Thank you very much for this generous gift to my colleagues .
Mr President , the state of tropical forests is worrying on two counts , as the impoverishment of the forest is not only quantitative but also qualitative in nature .
The biodiversity of our planet is at stake .
He has identified some valid points , certain aspects of which I would like to examine more closely .
It would seem to me absolutely essential to reflect on the scope of the regulation .
Firstly , programmes must be more closely targeted at the rehabilitation of tropical forests .
The Council regulation of 1995 perhaps focused in too exclusive a manner on the protection of tropical forests and not sufficiently closely on the harnessing of their productive potential .
Besides this , future Community actions must take into consideration every facet of sustainable forest management .
This implies respect for the indigenous peoples who depend on forest ecosystems .
There are , of course , forests in which there are no production activities of any type , but there are also forests that continue to fulfil an economic function .
This is the case with our own forests within the European Union , and I would ask my fellow Members what Community aid was provided for European forests after they were decimated by the storm that raged last December ?
We must without doubt take up the challenges laid down in this report , but must also institute a genuine Community policy on conservation and sustainable management .
For these and other reasons , Europe 's citizens rightly expect the Community to support actions to conserve and sustainably manage tropical forests .
The regulation also makes specific reference to the needs of indigenous and forest-dependent people and the need for gender considerations to be taken into account .
We have just discussed the environment regulation and the comments I made then on a number of horizontal issues are also largely applicable to the forest regulation .
For this reason , I will be brief .
With reference to the amendments listed in the Fernández Martín report , the Commission 's position on the main horizontal issues is as follows .
Financial reference account : the Commission accepts the compromise figure of EUR 249 million over seven years proposed in Amendment No 9 .
Duration of the regulation : in order to avoid conciliation , the Commission 's position is not to support Amendment No 12 , which places an unlimited duration on the regulations .
In our view the seven-year duration proposed by Council represents an acceptable compromise .
Bank guarantees : the Commission does not support Amendment No 8 concerning bank guarantees for reasons outlined earlier .
We are against special provisions being made in specific budget lines as this goes against our common objective , namely , to simplify and unify administrative procedures .
Furthermore , following a Commission decision in 1999 , we consider that the issue has been largely resolved .
Concerning the other amendments , our position is as follows .
The Commission welcomes and supports Amendments Nos 7 and 10 . Amendment No 4 is considered acceptable .
We do not support Amendments Nos 2 , 3 and 6 as we consider that the concepts have been taken into account elsewhere in the regulation following the first reading .
Hence , in the interest of clear and concise legislation , we would prefer that these amendments be dropped .
Amendment No 1 is not supported as in our opinion it brings little added value .
Given the Council 's negative position on this amendment , the Commission would favour it also being dropped .
Finally , we do not support Amendment No 5 as the term ' serious doubts ' is considered to be too subjective , making it very difficult to implement the regulation .
Furthermore , the objective of this amendment , namely , to avoid projects with negative social , cultural or economic or environmental effects , is addressed in Article 4 ( 5 ) on impact assessments .
Thank you , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Ship-generated waste and cargo residues
Now , Mr Jarzembowski , is the great moment !
Mr President , Commissioner , we are debating a directive which is extremely - I repeat extremely - rigorous .
We have been discussing the Erika disaster here for the past couple of weeks .
A whole ream of new measures on double hulls , inspection , the inspection of inspectorates , etc are being conceived in the short term .
Disasters of this kind account for no more than 3 % of oil pollution at sea .
Normal shipping operations account for double this amount .
Not only that .
If we consider our beaches , for example in the Netherlands - but also in other countries - 49 % of the rubbish washed up on the shore comes directly from the sea .
Only 15 % is due to tourism and a large proportion is even unaccountable for , although that , of course , must originate from somewhere .
I do not need to say any more concerning the motives underlying this directive .
I will only have positive things to say to the Commission about the quality of the directive .
There was nonetheless a whole raft of amendments at first reading which has been completely endorsed by Parliament .
I believe there were eighteen in total , a large proportion of which have been adopted , with a number of less important ones having been rejected .
These will re-emerge in some shape or form .
I would mainly like to home in on one very important point .
We all share the view throughout the Union that something needs to be done when the seas are polluted .
I would once again refer to the Erika , but there are also other examples .
We are also agreed that the polluter-pays principle must apply .
There is no financial incentive .
Let me illustrate this quite clearly .
Northern countries apply a system in which this financial element is handled in a different way .
Everyone pays , whether they dump their waste in the sea or dispose of it elsewhere .
In addition , there is some kind of financial incentive that contributes in some way or other to ensuring that this waste is disposed of .
Experience and scientific research has shown that this seems to work .
This is , in fact , what we are opting for . If the percentage is 90 % , so be it .
It could also be 75 % , but there should at least be a minimum level , which should be quite inflexible .
Otherwise we will fall back into a variety of systems and it will be years - in a manner of speaking - before we learn from the lesson we have actually already been taught .
I would therefore like to assure everyone that this is why it is sensible to opt for a system in which indirect costs are somehow absorbed in port dues .
If you read the Commission ' s proposal , a country could fall to 0.01 % of indirect costs if it so wishes . I fear that this will be opted for in practice .
This will also be the key point of discussion for the foreseeable future .
There is a whole raft of other factors involved and we have reached agreement on a great many of them .
I do believe that somehow we will make it .
But this is the crux of the matter and I wanted to draw everyone ' s attention to it .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I should like to stress that we had a good debate at the two readings .
May I thank the rapporteur , Mr Bouwman , very much for taking on this dossier and for elucidating it so well .
We are after all at one with the Council on three points .
Firstly , proper port reception facilities for ship-generated waste have to be constructed at every European port unless it already has them .
They must therefore be provided .
Secondly , all ships , regardless of the flag they fly , have to dispose of their waste .
Thirdly , the costs must be borne by the ship .
We agree on these points .
In fact , together we want to put a system in place so as to avoid there being financial incentives to dump waste into the sea .
Firstly , we wish to protect flora and fauna and secondly , there are a large number of coastlines along which , on the one hand , tourists enjoy themselves and on the other jobs are to be created .
That means that we want to have an effective system .
The really decisive difference is the issue of how the disposal costs are charged to the ship .
Mr Bouwman has , of course , already explained this .
Surely if people have already paid the disposal costs then they will actually dispose of the waste in port .
The other system is the pure polluter-pays principle : anyone who lands ship-generated waste has to pay extra for doing so .
This second system has proved to be ineffective , otherwise why would the Mediterranean Sea be so dirty ?
Why would the North Sea be so dirty ?
Because for lack of adequate controls the polluter-pays principle does not work !
That is the decisive issue .
We are prepared to reach an agreement with the Council .
But so far the Council has rejected any serious agreement with us .
That is why I call on the House to support our amendment whereby a significant proportion - up to 90 % - of the costs have to be covered by the general port dues .
This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure , whether it be on 75 % or whatever .
That is also why I would make the following request of the Commission : Madam Vice-President , think carefully about which side you stand on !
I believe that in the interests of protecting the environment and of a permanently thriving tourist industry in many countries of our Community it is better to have an effective system .
For these reasons support our ' no-special-fee ' system .
Perhaps then we will reach a reasonable compromise with the Council in the conciliation procedure .
There are a few points at stake tomorrow .
Firstly , we know that the ship is the most environmentally friendly mode of transport for carrying passengers and goods .
At the same time we know that ships make a hefty contribution to polluting the sea with rubbish , cargo residues and oily slime .
The fuel used by ships happens to be heavy oil and we know that this heavy oil leaves a residue of between 1 % and 3 % as oily slime , which is typically discharged into the sea .
I think that we agree that ships have to dispose of waste and residues in port .
It follows - and in fact there is no other logical conclusion - that the cardinal rule for clean seas is that it must no longer be worthwhile for waste to be disposed of illegally on the high seas .
This is what this is about , and a majority of us have said as much in debates here .
In January we had a very thorough debate with you , Commissioner , on the consequences of the Erika disaster .
On this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas .
And this directive on port reception facilities for cargo residues is , of course , also about the question of how to make our seas cleaner .
This scandal is not acceptable in the eyes of the Council either .
The Council is after all also saying that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities available and must be equipped with them .
The conflict now is ultimately over the issue of how payments will be made .
In its first reading , Parliament said by a large majority that the ships must make a significant contribution , of at least 90 % .
And therein lies the difference with the Council , which is saying that a contribution has to be made .
But a contribution might also only mean half a euro and in this case God knows this would be too little .
Nothing would change .
There would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules .
The same conditions must apply to all ships in port and only if Parliament , the Council and the Commission create these conditions together will this fair competition be restored for ports and ships .
I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and , in particular , Parliament .
I think that people are tired of seeing the hypocrisy of Europe and of ministers each time that there is a catastrophe , as we saw of course with ' Erika ' .
We will not be able to rule out accidents altogether , but we can take optimal precautions .
This consistent directive is an important step towards doing this .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , congratulations on your report .
You have said so yourself just now : we desperately need this directive .
It is a sound directive .
Ports must be equipped with reception facilities .
Inspection is on its way , at long last .
Member States must also impose sanctions when these rules are broken . This is very important .
This is good for the environment .
Investments are already being made , in anticipation of the directive .
For example , in Antwerp , very near to where I live , a huge installation is being built which was not there before .
As such , this directive is already coming into effect in a sense .
There is one point , as already highlighted by Mr Jarzembowski , where we do not see eye to eye .
How do we charge the fees ?
We are all agreed on the polluter pays principle .
But should he pay an automatic full amount or a huge amount in port dues , or do we opt for a flexible arrangement , as is being proposed by the Council .
Where is the best financial incentive , to use your words ?
I have sounded out a number of people on this subject .
The opinions are divided . Habits , apparently , are also divided .
In fact , ports in one and the same region apply different standards and percentages .
There are also ports which change percentages at the last minute , if I may say so .
I believe that as such , it is probably better if we in Parliament do not pin ourselves down on a fixed percentage .
A flexible system under these conditions , as you said so yourself , should make up a substantial part of the costs .
0.01 is clearly not a substantial part .
If the objectives of the directive cannot be achieved , we would expect the Commission to intervene , act , suggest changes and ensure that the system does work .
Fellow MEPs , we must rescue this directive and keep it come what may .
I hope that we will not jeopardise the entire directive on account of a too principled stance on one point .
Mr President , it is not so long ago that many held the view that waste would disappear if you dumped it in the sea or shot it into space .
These days , we know that waste has a habit of reappearing , often in a more harmful form .
Large-scale pollution of the sea and the destruction of the animal life caused by shipwrecked tankers always attracts a great deal of attention .
Far less attention is given to the fact that seas are polluted on a daily basis by regular merchant navy ships and recreational yachts .
It is high time that we laid down a comprehensive regulation which is easy to monitor and which ensures that shipping waste is collected and processed at ports in an environmentally-friendly manner .
We can benefit from practical experience gained in ports such as my home town , Rotterdam .
I am under the impression that the rapporteur has sought the best possible solution and has listened carefully to the comments .
Other solutions would probably have a less favourable effect on environmental protection , and my group can assent to this report on that basis .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , I too should like to thank Mr Bouwman for his efforts to broker a consensus of opinion within the committee .
No absolute consensus was found but that ' s politics for you .
Waste management facilities are to be built in ports and I believe this directive will definitely help considerably in limiting marine pollution .
It is now evident , particularly from this debate , that there is a bone of contention here .
I can understand my fellow Members ' concern that many unscrupulous masters will discharge waste at sea in order to avoid paying fees , but I would like to say that there is another side to the coin .
I would like to say that we have made some progress here .
Let us hold on to the progress which we have made with this directive , namely the provision for a charging system based on certain objective criteria .
Mr President , every day five million items of solid waste are thrown overboard from ships .
This rubbish drifts across the seas and ends up on beaches , severely damaging the environment and marine life .
As a result one million birds and a hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles are killed each year .
The MARPOL Convention aims to prevent pollution from ships but legislation is clearly necessary to ensure the convention is enforced .
An area where British Labour Members take issue with the rapporteur is the way in which the polluter-pays principle is to be applied .
The principle is one we strongly support but we believe it can be more effectively enforced if Member States retain the power to establish their own charging systems appropriate to their own circumstances .
For example , in the UK the system by which a ship pays the waste collector each time it uses waste facilities , without the port getting involved , works well .
It is based on a consensus which has been forged by all the players , including the ports and environmental groups like RSPB and the World Wildlife Fund .
However , we share the rapporteur 's concern that different charging systems should not lead to greater risk of maritime pollution .
That is why we back the Council proposal to strengthen the review clause to ensure the impact of the directive is monitored regularly .
Mr President , anyone who has witnessed the environmental consequences of the Erika disaster cannot reasonably vote against a report , the aim of which is to ensure that ship-generated waste oil is taken care of .
This is an extraordinarily important report .
It should be emphasised , in this context , that it is not mainly legislation that is missing .
All EU countries have signed the so-called MARPOL Convention , and the Baltic countries have also signed the Helsinki Convention .
The aim of both is to prevent discharges into the sea .
It is a question , rather , of increasing access to port reception facilities and of creating the motivation also to use these .
The Baltic is affected every year by a great many oil spills of greatly varying sizes . In Swedish waters alone , there are hundreds of these each year .
The Baltic is also more vulnerable from an environmental point of view than many other seas .
This is , as I see it , a sphere in which we have everything to gain by cooperating across national borders .
We can never in a million years solve Europe ' s environmental problems alone .
Finally , a word in the ear of those who , for financial reasons , are still hesitant : think what the alternative cost of cleaning up our seas would be .
There will come a time when we shall be able to meet imperatives of this kind .
We shall then be grateful if we have done everything in our power to prevent oil spills .
I would like to make it clear that there is a series of principles which are universal , and with which we are therefore in complete agreement .
First , every port must be equipped with the necessary facilities for the treatment of waste .
Secondly , polluters must pay , naturally .
I agree that there may be discrepancies in exceptions regarding the type of ship or devices for measuring the length of ships .
It is therefore on this issue that effective measures must be adopted because , if we are unable to adopt a suitable solution , then this directive will end in outright failure .
And the only outcome will be that some ports are advantaged and others disadvantaged , all due to fine words on the environment leading to a competitive war between ports .
Any decision that , for example , enables the Member States to grant subsidies to the different ports , would end up distorting competition and would ultimately be ineffective .
I believe that the work we are discussing today is a great step forward .
As you know , the Commission is extremely concerned about marine pollution .
In this respect , I believe that the legislation intended by this directive covers various aspects relating to the delivery of waste to ports .
It obliges all Community ports to be equipped with appropriate reception facilities for waste , and to guarantee the planning of their management , which will be supervised by the authorities of the Member States .
Furthermore , it obliges ships to deliver all ship-generated waste to the port , except where the ship has a sufficient storage capacity to enable it to arrive at the next stage , the next port .
It also obliges ships to notify the port that they are going to deliver waste prior to their arrival in the port , and to pay the cost of the reception facilities .
And this is where the problem lies .
As various speakers have already pointed out , this is where the positions of Parliament and the Commission differ fundamentally .
It is true that we are not specifying what percentage will have to be paid by the ships arriving at the port .
It is true that we are leaving a margin of flexibility for the Member States , but it is also certain that , theoretically , 0.01 , although it is a contribution , is not necessarily a significant contribution .
Perhaps we could incorporate the word " significant " into the text instead of setting a fixed percentage .
But I would try , first of all , to take this step forward , making the position more flexible with the possibility of revising it .
I could go on , but the two reasons have already been stated .
We are all working towards the same goal .
The only difference of opinion is over how best to achieve this goal .
I would ask for support for a more positive position , supplemented - I insist - with Amendment No 16 by Mr Sterckx , which would provide us with the necessary guarantees .
Many thanks , Mr President .
I would like to reiterate my appreciation to the rapporteur and the rest of the Committee .
Thank you , Madam Vice-President .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles
Mr President , Commissioner , there comes a time when you have to - what a shame , she is not listening when people speak , that is not good !
A good Commissioner should listen !
Can that be deducted from the time ?
Commissioner , I actually wanted to address a minor comment to you , which applies both to this report and to the preceding one .
There comes a time when you have to come to a decision , because post-Amsterdam the conciliation procedure is the great good .
Parliament is obviously always pleased when the Commission fights at Parliament 's side as its partner and does not necessarily rush obediently to the Council 's cause .
I do not believe that this is necessary here .
I wanted actually to relate this comment to the report before us .
The President has read out a very laborious title .
Mr President , with your permission I will simply talk about lorry inspections ; that would be understood both in Regensburg and in Lübeck , and perhaps the Commission might also perhaps manage to use somewhat shorter titles .
I think that we simply cannot do enough for road traffic safety .
There is a consensus on that .
This directive on lorry inspections should quite simply make a contribution to this .
We are seeing a slight fall in the number of those killed and injured on the roads .
Nevertheless - and regrettably - where the accidents involve lorries the numbers of those both killed and injured are rising .
The causes are often precisely technical defects .
We must not sit back and accept this .
After all , a lorry does around 150 000 kilometres a year .
This is an inconceivably high number compared with a private car .
When it is under a strain of this kind , maximum technical roadworthiness is required in the interests of road safety , environmental protection and not least equitable competition .
Because a fleet of lorries in a poor state of technical repair should certainly not have a competitive advantage , and conversely no haulier should be punished if he keeps his lorries in optimal technical condition .
Now Europeans are obviously not so well behaved that they can manage without checks .
This directive tries to cater for this problem by introducing a graduated inspection procedure until the vehicle is taken out of service .
There has been a high measure of agreement between Parliament , the Council and the Commission , apart from on one problem and that is penalties .
In its common position , the Council makes no mention of any arrangements .
This is obviously nonsense because if I am going to carry out inspections there have to be penalties which I can use as a threat in borderline cases .
Then the Council said - and these might not be its exact words - that the penalties would be directed at the Member States .
No , penalties should be directed at hauliers , lorry-owners and drivers .
That is why - as discussed in the committee - I have now tabled an amendment to Amendment No 2 which contains no reference to the concept of ' harmonisation ' .
That would not make any sense .
Neither is it very European .
If the Bureau , which will be chairing the vote tomorrow , could be informed of this I would be very grateful .
Then we would not have any procedural problems with this .
So , put Amendment No 3 to the vote first .
It would then replace Amendment No 2 .
This is what was discussed in the committee , and then we could have this system very quickly and not work towards a costly conciliation procedure for the sake of a solution which is in principle sensible .
Mr President , everything has been said .
Allow me simply to offer the Vice-President a helping hand so that she might support Amendment No 3 - which replaces No 2 - after all .
In this room there are sometimes Members who say that of course it is sensible to standardise the vehicle inspections in terms of how rigorous and how comprehensive they are .
That is why I think that this Amendment No 3 which Mr Piecyk has drafted as rapporteur is excellent .
He has completely avoided the word ' harmonisation ' .
But he has said what this is all about .
Given the danger to the passengers and also other drivers this would , however , be necessary .
That is why this is not about the question of whether we are in favour of subsidiarity or centralism .
The first principle , Madam Vice-President , is for us all to attach the same degree of importance to the need to improve road safety .
The second argument is that there must be no distortions of competition in the Community .
Could I begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work on this very important dossier , and by congratulating the Commissioner and the Commission for bringing forward this proposal .
We are all very aware that one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency , quite rightly , is to tackle the scandalous position regarding road safety in the European Union .
I know they are familiar figures , but 43 000 citizens are killed each and every year .
That is the equivalent to a medium-sized town being wiped off the face of the earth every year .
We therefore welcome this initiative as a means of at least trying to ensure the heavy goods vehicles are as safe as is possible and comply with Community legislation .
Lorry traffic on EU roads is growing both in numbers and in size and we think there are three reasons why this proposal is so important .
Firstly , the safety argument that we have already heard about .
Thirdly , there are also the environmental benefits - the possibility of ensuring quieter and less polluting vehicles .
There is clearly a need for EU-wide random checks , and the UK - my own Member State - has already been applying such a system with very positive results .
I welcome this initiative and I hope it can be put into effect as soon as possible .
Mr President , Commissioner , reforming the directive on annual inspections of commercial vehicles is both urgent and vital .
The rapporteur has adopted a perfectly good position in this issue , in the final analysis .
Drivers of commercial vehicles run up thousands of kilometres every year , and the roadworthiness of the vehicles cannot be monitored adequately by means of mere annual inspections .
Roadside spot checks are also necessary because heavy goods vehicles from non-member countries often enter the area of the Union in bad condition , presenting a serious risk to safety .
The directive will be more efficacious if the Member States can negotiate a harmonised system of penalties .
This should not , however , slow down the prompt implementation of the directive .
Justification for the prompt reform of the directive is provided by something that happened recently in Finland .
The police and the vehicle inspection authorities were conducting a spot check of sixty-two heavy goods vehicles in eastern Finland recently . The drivers of thirty-three of them received fines , and sixteen received a warning .
Three vehicles were prohibited from continuing their journey .
Only thirteen were in fully acceptable condition .
A considerable number of the vehicles in bad condition were from non-member countries .
The worst case was a Polish truck with no brakes in the drawing vehicle , a poorly secured load , and a trailer whose brakes were badly leaking .
Everyone can imagine what sort of safety hazard such a lorry would be on roads covered in snow and ice .
Our group supports Amendment No 3 and hopes the new version of the directive will come into force promptly .
It is precisely in those countries that employment permits and work contracts are not checked up on .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President , ladies and gentlemen , safety on our roads is of great concern to us all .
The best directive will be ineffective in everyday life if it does not provide any penalties for non-compliance or violations .
In any case we must prevent this from being dealt with thoughtlessly , precisely because this is about a directive which provides for rules not only for heavy goods vehicles but also for commercial vehicles carrying people .
Time and again we are all severely shaken when there are major accidents which are due purely to technical defects .
Because of this I am glad that the report is not actually controversial and that Parliament is once again proving to be the driving force in the debate about traffic safety on Europe 's roads .
My particular thanks go to all those who work with such dedication in this field in the committee , in the Commission and in the Council .
Mr President , Commissioner de Palacio , the purpose of the proposal the Commission made in 1998 is to replace the directive concerning annual inspections of commercial vehicles .
The motion proposes the introduction of spot checks , as vehicles have to be deemed roadworthy between tests too .
These spot tests may be carried out at the roadside , at ports and harbours or where trucks are parked .
This is , then , a matter of improving road safety in the EU , which is vital .
A major cause of concern in the European Union area is the poor state of the trucks coming from Eastern Europe .
They need to be dealt with strictly . Being from East Karelia , I know that even if they had one light and the wheel brakes on one side working , it would be something .
The Council ' s common position will improve road safety considerably , and the directive should enter into force as soon as possible .
In establishing penal systems , however , it is important to realise that penalties must on no account be targeted at the Member State , but the driver or company involved .
Enlightenment is a good thing , but , unfortunately , only proper penalties have an effect on hypocrites .
Road safety is a serious matter .
I recall a tragic accident in Helsinki a few weeks ago in which a wheel that had come off a lorry killed a small child .
We can never assume too much responsibility when it comes to human life .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , once again I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Piecyk , and the corresponding parliamentary committee for the work carried out .
It is certain that the rapporteur is entirely correct in saying that the title is very long .
The proposal requires that the Member States supplement the annual technical inspection by carrying out spot checks in proportion to the fleet of commercial vehicles in circulation annually on their roads .
These inspections may be carried out by the roadside , in ports and in other places where vehicles park , or , as is more frequent in the case of public service vehicles , on the operator 's premises .
This may in fact be the best way to effectively monitor the state of the vehicles in circulation on our roads .
We also accept Amendment No 1 , and I would like to refer to what Mr Bouwman said .
Once again , I would like to reiterate my appreciation of the quality of work carried out , not only by the rapporteur , but by the committee as a whole .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Closing of the session
I declare the 1999-2000 session closed .
( The sitting was closed at 10.41 p.m. )
Opening of the session
I declare resumed the 2000-2001 session of the European Parliament .
Agenda
Mr President , the second item on this morning ' s agenda is the recommendation for second reading on cocoa and chocolate products , for which I am the rapporteur .
Quite by accident I learnt yesterday , at 8.30 p.m. , that the vote was to take place at noon today .
It was however initially scheduled , I thought , for noon tomorrow .
I have therefore been caught completely off guard by this , and have not even had the chance to draw up the lists of votes and to see whether there are any roll-calls or not .
You know as well as I do that this matter is quite controversial and well reported in the media .
I have been a Member of this Parliament for ten years and I have always been given notice , in my capacity as rapporteur , of any changes to the order of voting .
I should prefer for this vote to be held tomorrow .
It would suit me , personally , and I do not think anyone would have any objection , since it is a relatively brief vote .
Mr President , we do not have anything against postponing the vote .
However , I insist on the other scheduled votes , particularly those on the Lisbon Summit , going ahead tomorrow .
We have nothing against postponement , with this proviso .
The competent services have informed me that tomorrow ' s list of subjects will be rather lengthy .
Mr President , like Mr Lannoye , late last night I too was faced with the fact that the vote on my report at second reading is planned for 12.00 p.m.
The groups have emphatically asked me to urge you not to let the vote take place at 12.00 p.m. but tomorrow instead , as they have not had the chance to apply for split and roll-call votes .
After all , it came as a complete surprise that the vote was planned for 12.00 p.m.
I would therefore ask , also on behalf of many others , to postpone the vote until tomorrow .
Mr Blokland , the officials of the competent services have informed me that your report will automatically be put to the vote tomorrow .
I now ask the House whether it agrees to postpone the vote on the Lannoye report until tomorrow .
If we are all in agreement , that is what the arrangement will be .
Annual legislative programme ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the European Commission ' s annual legislative programme for the year 2000 .
Being a parliamentarian , that does not please me , but I have to accept the situation , for the moment at least , and until further notice .
But this also means that the Commission faces an immense challenge .
If you want to bring about the great turning point you mentioned , Mr President of the Commission , then you had better make a start on this damn quickly .
In the light of this responsibility , Mr President of the Commission , when you made your last speech here in this House , you proposed concentrating more heavily on core tasks .
This could also be described in terms of carrying out or implementing the subsidiarity principle .
However , at the same time , we must be clear about the fact that this must not amount to offloading tasks that are too complicated and difficult for the Commission .
We must also be under no illusions , Mr President of the Commission , as to the fact that we must get straight down to work on these criteria and the core tasks I mentioned .
What distinguishes us Social Democrats from other groups in this House is not so much the multitude of tasks and the number of proposals that are to come , as the direction they are heading in .
We want to reinforce Europe ' s role on the international stage in a clear and unequivocal manner , just as we want to increase its competitiveness .
Above all , we must aim to make Europe more socially aware , to create a Europe of equal opportunities , and to increase security and quality of life within Europe .
That said , we do not want to bureaucratise Europe and neither do we want to centralise it .
That is not how we envisage Europe to be !
If you make these your goals , Mr President of the Commission , then we will be behind you every step of the way .
Moving onto another point : the Commission has passed a long list of its intentions to Parliament .
We decided , in our wisdom , to draft a resolution which may not be quite as long but which provides you with a whole host of proposals and some counter-proposals .
Exchanging lists in this way is not an ideal way to engage in dialogue .
Therefore , in future , we should think of something different .
That would seem to me to make a lot more sense than the course of action we are taking this week - not for the first time , but hopefully the last !
Mr President of the Commission , I would just like to pick up again on your expression " decisive year " .
We must all make it our business to follow the debates on Europe in the various individual Member States , and not just in those we happen to come from .
It is not about preventing globalisation , we would not succeed there in any case .
The only way forward is to form this global outlook on the basis of our own values and diversity .
To this end , therefore , we must work together to bring about a significant improvement in communication , which is something you yourself mentioned .
You are in the process of drafting a communication strategy for the enlargement of the European Union .
If we do not manage to upgrade our channels of communication in this way then our common goal , to wit , a higher turnout at the next European elections , will not be within our sights .
This would be a shame , not just for us MEPs - who may no longer be here in that case - but for Europe as well .
Mr President , my Group would like to welcome the annual legislative programme .
However , we have some concerns about the process .
Indeed , to carry the metaphor further and using the English usage , if we were going to make a meal from these it would be rather long and rather indigestible .
I understand that it has been the normal tradition to obediently produce these lists .
There has been much talk about concentrating on core tasks and of achieving better quality of European legislation rather than more quantity .
All this sits rather uneasily with endless lists .
With this in mind , we produced a one-page resolution highlighting key areas .
However , this has not reached the compromise resolution , so we wish now to put down a clear marker for the future about how this process should be conducted .
This would get away from the shopping-list approach and give more political focus .
It would allow Parliament to participate fully in the process , not just by swapping shopping lists with you .
What we would like to do is catch the imagination of Europe 's citizens .
Mr President , I shall not repeat the general criticism we expressed during the previous sitting of Parliament regarding the orientations of the European Commission ' s work .
The programme submitted to us for this year is generous , to say the least .
It contains some positive elements and some less positive elements .
I should like to draw attention to one area that I feel is rather deficient , the area of social policy .
This would not be too serious if significant progress had been made during the five previous years , but this is not the case .
Indeed , in terms of social policy , the Commission and Parliament have the opportunity to promote many things .
According to the terms of Chapter I of Title 11 of the Treaty , in particular , I am thinking specifically of problems to do with working conditions and improving the working environment .
Regarding , in particular , the health and safety of workers , we are now governed by the terms of a directive dating from 1989 .
In my opinion and in the opinion of my Group , this directive is due for re-evaluation , particularly in the light of a significant study published in 1997 by the Dublin Foundation .
This shows a general decline in working conditions in a number of important sectors .
This needs looking into and I would like to see the Commission investigate the matter thoroughly and assess what needs to be amended in this directive in order to improve the situation .
In this respect , I should like to make two firm requests on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
I should have liked to present these as demands from Parliament but it is enough , today , for them to be firm requests .
For example , in the environmental field , we have a White Paper on civil liability in environmental matters .
This is an important step forwards , but let me remind you all the same that this White Paper is the follow-up to a Parliament resolution adopted in 1994 , that is to say , six years ago .
And after the White Paper we shall probably have to wait a long time before we have the directive .
This shows just how slow the procedure is and , in order to give reasons for this slowness , I feel it would be important to have an interim report .
My second point : when a legislative proposal is announced within the legislative programme and is not achieved by the end of the current year , then we should know the reasons why .
Let me give one example of this .
Today , a proposal for a directive on electrical and electronic waste has been announced .
This proposal has already been put forward several times , but has never been tabled .
President Prodi , a friendly word of advice .
Mr President , I welcome the broad thrust of the proposals published by the Commission in its annual legislative programme for the year 2000 .
The most important issues that will be addressed this year will be the reform of the EU decision-making procedures , so that the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner .
As a Member of the Parliament from the constituency of Connaught Ulster in Ireland , a peripheral part of this Union , I strongly believe in real and tangible representation for smaller Member States within the EU structures .
At present , the five larger Member States have two posts within the European Commission and there is one each for the smaller Member States .
Whatever the reform , it is vitally important that smaller Member States retain their right to nominate a Member of the Commission .
Undoubtedly , the European Council , representing the fifteen governments , will have to reform its structures .
From an Irish perspective , I strongly believe that Member State governments must have a veto over tax changes at EU level .
No changes at present can be agreed at EU level concerning tax policies without the unanimous support of all EU Member States .
I believe this is an important right , which should be left in the domain of national Member States .
In my own country , the tax regime is quite innovative in many ways .
The tax burden on middle and lower income workers has been steadily reduced , while sensible tax breaks have been given to encourage business enterprises .
This cannot be said of many of the other Member States .
Any proposal to give the European Council the power of qualified majority voting on justice and home affairs would be , I believe , very unwise .
In conclusion , can I say that I am very pleased that the President has , this morning , referred to fisheries .
He said he believes it is lagging behind - that real progress must be made in the year 2002 , because fisheries are established in areas where there is no alternative source of employment .
Of course we want to ensure by the year 2002 that the countries that suffered most when the common fisheries policy was put in place in 1983 will in future receive a fair and equitable share of the resources .
In conclusion , can I say that on a broader level it is important that the European Union , as an economic entity , does not fall behind in the global search for e-commerce opportunities .
The Commission must support educational and training programmes , to ensure that business structures take account of the opportunities which can be secured from the Internet and e-commerce in general .
An information technology revolution is certainly upon us . We cannot be passengers when these changes take place .
We must be leaders of our business communities and of our educational institutions , so that information technology initiatives are incorporated into all key social and economic sectors of our society .
Mr President , Mr Prodi ' s Commission will not last for five years because people will not , in the longer term , put up with detailed regulation from Brussels .
It is perhaps difficult to know who is going to provide the salutary shock , and when .
That is often the case with historical new departures .
Coincidences play their part and minor matters can suddenly loom large because small things come to symbolise what is fundamental .
The fundamental paradox is that the Union identifies itself as being more and more democratic , at the same time as democracy is being quite systematically cut back in our countries .
Last month , Mr Prodi talked of a radical decentralisation of the Union ' s activities .
It is Orwellian to a T. Under the heading of ' decentralisation ' , centralisation is taking place .
Under the heading of ' democracy ' , democracy is being dismantled .
Under the heading of ' greater transparency ' , the Commission is proposing an arrangement through which documents that are at present available for public inspection will be locked away .
When he took up office , Mr Prodi solemnly promised - before our Group and here in the House - a completely new approach to transparency .
We were to be able to have access to any document , once the Commission had given it to others .
The elected representatives of the people would no longer be the last to be informed .
We should no longer have to sit in the committee rooms looking at the students from the Permanent Representations , in possession of documents to which we ourselves have no access .
We should no longer have to tolerate a situation in which the employers in the European Union or the farming industry ' s COPA can consult documents which we ourselves cannot obtain .
It is fundamental to a democracy that the executive should serve the electorate and the electorate ' s representatives .
In the EU , the legislature has been transferred to the executive .
The elected representatives of the people are awarded monopolies on power , while fundamental documents from the decision-making process are kept secret .
At the Conference of the Presidents , we decided to summon the ombudsman and Mr Prodi to a discussion concerning transparency .
I hope that Mr Prodi will say : ' I am sorry , I was not aware that my officials were doing the opposite of what I had promised .
I stand by my words . Here is my signature to the transparency that was promised ' .
Thank you , if there is , in fact , anything to say thank-you for .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Poettering for what he had to say in this connection .
In the run-up to the Intergovernmental Conference , special emphasis is being placed on the European Union ' s ability to function , which is in every sense pre-requisite to the success of the European unification process .
However , in refusing to talk - albeit only bilaterally - and thereby causing a breakdown in communication , the 14 EU partner States are putting this self-same " ability to function " at great risk .
The Commission must not stand idly by in a situation of this kind .
It has a duty to see to it that the solidarity enshrined in the Treaties is upheld .
In acknowledgement of my responsibility as a parliamentarian , I myself sent a letter to this effect to all the Heads of Government yesterday .
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , for his work programme .
I concur with the remarks made that there should be more focus , but also that it should be better tailored to the five-year plan .
It seems as if we are talking about two different documents .
The first chapter of the work programme is entitled : " Europe , its neighbours and the world " and rightly so .
I have permission to quote one of the first sentences from this chapter : " the Union must be active on the regional and world stage . "
In our opinion , it is also essential that the Commission ' s role be reinforced in the field of foreign policy .
We want to project a much stronger , united front as far as this European foreign policy is concerned .
But the instruments involved are also an important factor . They help in the analysis of non-military crises and help us to act on them quickly .
If we look at Mozambique , for example , how long have we had to wait before real action could be taken ?
This is about very concrete issues , such as transport capacity .
To this end , we need swifter coordination within the European Union .
Take the enormous cattle losses Mongolia has suffered .
We know that there are funds available in TACIS and ECHO within the European Union .
But why are we not helping out ?
This is because there are too many bureaucratic hurdles .
The EU ' s overseas dealings will need to be better tuned to our need for a stronger , future European foreign policy .
In short , operational implementation is central .
Relations with Russia are of vital importance .
We find ourselves in a situation in which we cannot afford to fall behind the Council of Europe , which has levelled criticism at Russia concerning its Chechnya policy .
It is extremely depressing to note that freedom of press is still not guaranteed in Russia .
We had invited the journalist , Mr Babitsky , to visit us next Thursday , but this was vetoed by the Russian authorities .
I hope that the European Commission too , will protest in the strongest terms to the Russian authorities .
Mr President , Mr Prodi , when a parliament discusses legislative priorities then everything becomes a priority .
As far as I am concerned , the top priorities are : employment - and , consequently , economic growth - and quality of life - and therefore environmental protection , food safety and consumer rights .
I should now like to make a few comments on economic and social matters .
One of the Commission ' s initiatives , which deserves a high priority , is the e-Europe initiative .
Yesterday we discussed the Lisbon Summit for the economic and social revival of Europe .
Shared objectives for growth in order to enable us to move towards full employment are something I have hoped and prayed for .
Full employment does not mean the total absence of any form of unemployment . There will always be some cyclical unemployment , with workers looking to change jobs , young people entering the labour market .
But full employment will be restored when there are no longer any long-term unemployed and when every young person is offered at least one training course within at least six months of entering the job market .
It is possible if we invest to a greater extent in what Mr Guterres yesterday called ' human capital ' , i.e. basic education plus , most importantly , lifelong training .
In this context , the e-Europe initiative comes at just the right moment .
In future , the computer-related content of jobs is going to be increasingly marked , but we have a lack of workers qualified in this area , as do the United States .
That is why the American Senate has made available a quota of almost 500 000 visas for a period of four years , reserved for highly qualified immigrant workers .
What we should be doing is educating our own intelligent young people and keeping them in Europe .
A Commission document has just shown that half of the young people who pursue postgraduate studies in the United States go on to stay there .
In order to keep our brainpower , to attract the best brains and to train them further , we must make massive investments in research and development .
Surely this provides the rest of Europe with an example to be followed ?
In this connection , I should also like to applaud Commissioner Philippe Busquin ' s initiative to create a European research area .
Improved living conditions , employment and the quality of employment will continue to be intimately linked to our ability to make European research more dynamic .
Along the same lines , a proper European patent , the development of venture capital and support for young businesses are also of crucial importance .
Last night President Prodi reiterated my expression regarding Europe ' s lack of future prospects .
We all know that we are living through a paradigm shift with the advent of the information society and the development society .
But , in a world where 1.5 billion people are still living without electricity , providing every citizen in the world with access to the Internet society is not going to be achieved in the immediate future .
The annual legislative programme is the most concrete manifestation of the European Commission 's key constitutional and political power , namely the exclusive right of initiative .
Such power must at all times be rigorously justified and clearly explained .
Yet this year 's work programme , as in all previous years , does not provide detailed justification for each of the multitude of new measures proposed .
A 15-page general summary does not exactly do justice to the 500 initiatives cited in the annex .
In future , the ELDR will therefore insist that there is clear justification for , and specialised parliamentary debate on , all measures announced in the work programme .
In other words , it is now high time for a comprehensive overhaul of the somewhat antiquated way in which this crucial programming document is developed and debated in future .
Mr President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission for giving us two speeches within the space of 24 hours .
The Commission President 's speech this morning raises three concerns in my mind .
Subsidiarity must be seen to apply : it must be clear that we are not legislating where it is not necessary to do so .
The second concern relates to budgets .
On behalf of my group I would like to caution the Commission not to go ahead at this stage with shifting agricultural expenditure from category 1 to category 4 .
Lastly , a word of caution about the question of information .
This is what bedevilled the relationship between our Parliament and the previous Commission : the fact that we , under the Treaties , have access and the right of access to all information in principle .
It looks as if we are running into difficulties with our framework agreement .
As Mr Bonde rightly pointed out , we should have a European Union where there is a free flow of information from the bureaucracy to all our citizens .
Mr President of the Commission , when you entered upon your duties , you said that the Commission would be characterised by openness .
A lot of other people have also said that here today .
But what is the situation now ?
Why are the Commission ' s press conferences no longer being broadcast directly via satellite television so that everyone in all parts of Europe can follow what is happening ?
I hope that Mr Prodi is listening .
Regarding your letter to Mrs Fontaine about the ombudsman , Mr Prodi , do you consider that the ombudsman is bound by any principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions ?
Where , in that case , do you find a legal basis for this view , and do you believe that such a principle can suppress the ombudsman ' s right to express himself freely in the press ?
The main question , however , is that of whether the principle of loyal cooperation should take precedence over the right to express oneself .
Where is the basis for a principle in accordance with which you could suppress this right and make such demands upon the ombudsman ?
Mr President , the report you have presented is ambitious and complex , and I will only touch on a few points .
We consider that , with the implementation of the geo-political processes , the Mediterranean border is just important as eastward enlargement , which both Parliament and the Commission are working on .
Two : the internal market .
Working in the European Parliament , we can see that harmonisation of the existing legislation on civil law is essential .
In all probability , we ought to start work in the field of administrative law as well .
Moreover , every day , we become more aware of the need for a common legal system coordinating the different legal systems of the Member States .
Three : the preparatory documents .
I can only add my voice to the requests to limit the use of preparatory documents , which are presented several times by several different people in the European Parliament .
Lastly : the Commission ' s Work Programme seems to overlook two sectors which are in need of particular attention from the European institutions , especially in the light of the developments constantly taking place in e-commerce .
I feel that the Commission should submit proposals on the out-of-court settlement of disputes over on-line contracts and on amendments to the Directive on distance contracts , in order to provide increasingly effective consumer protection .
Mr President , with regard to fishing , I am not going to go into the details of the Commission ' s legislative proposals .
However , I would like to hear a clear commitment from the Commission that it will seek a solution for the speedy transposition into Community law of the recommendations of the regional and international fishing organisations .
Delays in transposition are an endemic problem in the Commission .
The Commission is always accusing Member States of not transposing its decisions and directives into their national legislation , while it is doing exactly the same thing on an international level .
From the point of view of this institution , there are serious doubts as to whether this is the best way to resolve this problem .
Mr President , the previous Commission worked under the motto " do less in order to do better " , as opposed to the supposedly active approach of the Delors Commission .
As we know , it is a question of quality rather than quantity , which was also mentioned by both Mr Schulz and Mr Swoboda , speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group .
The question is in which direction this Commission is heading .
I hope that this Prodi Commission is not one which does less in order to do it better , but rather one which does what has to be done .
To this end , I hope that the Commission will bear in mind the points of view being expressed in the European Parliament .
In this respect , I would like to refer to the codification of Community law .
At the moment , Community law is an impenetrable jungle , absolutely incomprehensible to the citizens of the Community , including those whose profession involves the exercise of the law .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to remind you of a text which is mentioned in the Commission communication .
It is point 2 ( 3 ) on the statute of the outermost regions , which is to be implemented by the Commission .
Today the Commission is to speak of the first document in this field , and I hope that , in doing so , it will take account of the requirements of these outermost regions of the Community .
Mr President , the President of the Commission will not be surprised if I speak to him about the internal market .
What has the reform of the Commission to do with the internal market ?
The answer is a lot .
This guiding principle is mainly the protection of the Community ' s financial interests .
That is clearly of concern to all of us , but it is only a starting point .
From there on , the Commission must begin to work , and must fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Treaty .
Allow me to give you an example , since the speaking time allotted to me does not give me much opportunity to expand on this idea .
Let us consider the intended reform of the infringement procedure .
What is the intention there ?
It is simply said that this administrative procedural law will not be created , but rather demands will be selected .
How can this be ?
How can these things be selected in a purely arbitrary way .
From the point of view of this Parliament , this type of arrangement cannot be allowed . We understand that the Commission has to be reformed .
Thank you , Mr Prodi , for your presentation and your documentation .
Congratulations on using the Internet for the general public - a very good idea .
I will start with trade .
We agree with you that we need a rules-based trading system .
It is essential .
It displayed incredible insensitivity to the legitimate concerns of the developing world and , frankly , the developing world has little so far to thank the WTO for .
Please , can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen .
Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century .
How much innovation has taken place in the Commission , or indeed in the Parliament may I say ?
We had a White Paper on innovation some years ago - what has happened since ?
One thing I would like to say very strongly is that we are very concerned in follow-up , not simply in excellent communications , which we welcome , but in follow-up , follow-up , follow-up ! ! ! !
We have under way the Fifth Research Framework Programme - what has happened to what was learned in the Fourth ?
What is the dissemination for the new ideas , the new products , the new comparisons of socio-economic systems ?
Follow-up again , please .
We welcome incidentally the formation of a European research area which you and Commissioner Busquin have put forward .
This is an excellent way in which to begin the century .
I welcome the forthcoming communication on enterprise , but I hope that past work will also be looked at before we go ahead with more .
I will now use a tremendous cliché truism - ' our greatest resource in the European Union is our people ' .
Is it not shameful that large Member States like my own and Germany cannot supply the number of people skilled in information technology ?
Is it not disgraceful that they are having to attract people from countries where those skills are needed ?
It is a disgrace and I hope that you will take it up when you look at legislation .
A further shocking waste of resources , Commissioner , is that women in technical , scientific and information technology fields are squandering their skills .
I hope there will be a follow-up to the Science White Paper .
Mr President , the internal reform of the Commission has begun .
We welcome that !
This is not the first attempt to turn the Commission into a world-class public service , but we , Mr Prodi , wish to believe in the sincerity and resolve of your promise to this House .
For the moment we have a series of measures and a White Paper .
Go for it !
However , I would like to point out one fault in the document .
For example , there previously were punitive measures or measures for assessing the merits of the civil servants , but , Mr Prodi , they were not used .
The officials responsible , including the Commissioners , did not make use of these measures , of these recourses which existed before .
Now that we are establishing new measures , how do we know they will be used ?
Only you know the answer to this secret .
The lack of motivation amongst excellent civil servants is serious .
We must take action and the example should come from above .
The reform of the Commission , Mr Prodi , should not only protect the financial interests of the Community .
Far more resources are lost through an ineffective and unmotivated administration .
Furthermore , we also have to accept that officials who take responsibility and risks may make mistakes .
You said in your speech that you prefer to make mistakes rather than fail to act .
Go for it , Mr Prodi .
Your task must be an historic task .
You are not the first to try it .
We hope that you succeed .
Mr President , it is interesting that Mr Prodi has presented today a work programme ; however , our agenda says that we are having a debate on a legislative programme .
Looking at it from the point of view of social and employment policy we certainly do not have a legislative programme before us .
In fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now .
What we have had instead is a process of consolidation and the development of certain convergence processes such as that developed and launched at Luxembourg .
We welcome the Luxembourg procedure .
We hope it will be deepened , strengthened and extended to other areas such as convergence in social protection .
But does that mean that we have done the job in terms of legislation in the social area ?
I think not .
There are a number of areas where we need to update and modernise the social legislation we have adopted in the past .
With the deepening and strengthening of the internal market and globalisation we are seeing an increasing number of mergers , take-overs and transfers within the European Union .
That means that we need to pursue with vigour the general framework on information and consultation at work .
But is it just about updating ?
No .
We do not need any new great raft of social legislation , but there are areas that have not been addressed .
There are other areas .
I had a woman come to see me recently , called Mrs Angela Elliot Mathis , working for Lucent Technologies .
She was head-hunted into the company at a very high level to work as a senior manager and a board member .
She had worked in a range of European countries for high technology companies .
Thirteen months into the job she was dismissed without notice and without reason .
She still has no reason for the dismissal .
The remarkable thing is that she has no protection in either Belgian law - she was working in Belgium - or European law .
Without that sort of protection people will not take the opportunity to live , move and work wherever they can within the European Union .
These are the gaps we need to plug .
Let us do it in the new medium-term Social Action Programme .
Mr President , I want to highlight the areas of the work programme which affect directly the work of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
With regard to regional policy , my group would like to see the Commission ensure the full application of the partnership principle at all levels of programming of the Structural Funds .
When , Mr President , will the Commission go further on spatial planning and submit new proposals to develop the decision taken at the informal Council meetings , notably at Potsdam and Tampere ?
Regarding transport and tourism , I and my group welcome the proposals reinforcing transport safety although we need more concrete proposals on road safety and in particular , the issue of blood-alcohol levels and speed limits .
I also welcome the ongoing commitment to the Galileo project and the review of the TENs strategy , especially with its highlight on the railway sector , a sector which we believe to be very important indeed .
However , I have to say to you that my group deplores the fact that several dossiers at this moment are blocked in Council .
We also want progress on both the working time directive and the slot allocation at airport directive , as well as measures to end the misery in air traffic control delays in Europe at this moment .
We are also concerned , President Prodi , at the lack of proposals concerning the tourism sector , a sector in which so many of our citizens work .
I also want to insist that Parliament ' s views and wishes on postal services , often stated in this chamber , are taken fully into account in any new proposals .
In the banana case , for example , we have not so far been able to reconcile the interests of our producers , those in the ACP countries , with the demands of the WTO .
Why not ?
Quite simply because the WTO , according to the Marrakech model , does not permit this , or permits it only with extreme difficulty .
Since Seattle has challenged the inadequacies of existing WTO agreements , I would argue strenuously in favour of the Union handling this issue in accordance with the rules which we intend to see predominate in international trade .
I would make the same call for coherence in another area , the management of the pigmeat crisis .
This is a situation which runs totally counter to our European farm model which is based on a multiplicity of diversified and multifunctional family farms .
My final point concerns the preparation of the budget for 2001 .
Admittedly , the budget lines for agriculture may be examined in order to reflect the need to show solidarity with the Balkans .
Can I take this opportunity to welcome the programme in the context of the five-year strategic plan .
I particularly wanted to congratulate President Prodi on emphasising the issue of governance in the overall planning process .
Therefore , opening up the invisible cities of decision-making in Europe to the citizenry is absolutely vital .
Can I welcome the annual programme in particular because there was one omission from the five-year plan . That was the whole area of education , youth and culture which did not make an appearance at all .
In moulding a greater Europe we have a significant challenge , but mobility in Europe - student mobility for instance - is still very low .
Only 2 % outside the old Erasmus programme of students are actually mobile in Europe , which is not something upon which we can build a new economy at all .
Again , we need a programme of education that matches the best practice across the whole of Europe .
We cannot develop a whole series of initiatives based on , for instance , small businesses or health on-line or whatever without educating people to be literate in those technologies .
This means perhaps looking again at all our educational programmes to see that they match the programmes we are particularly enthusiastic about .
Can I just , in finishing , say that we will have started four new programmes by the end of this year - Media , Culture 2000 , Youth and Socrates .
Mr President , I must object in the strongest possible terms to the proposal , within this legislative programme , to reduce the agricultural budget by EUR 300 million for the purpose of rebuilding Kosovo .
I do not accept that this will simply be a one-off event .
When farmers in my own constituency of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in more than 100 years , how can I explain to them that this EUR 300 million would be better off spent on Kosovo ?
We should be spending more to alleviate this crisis rather than contemplating spending less .
I urge honourable Members , when we come to vote on this issue , to vote against this proposal .
Mr President , I should like to return to the subject of the annual legislative programme , after that digression on the European budget .
I should like just to address one particular subject , which is the issue of what has happened to the initiatives that Parliament took under Article 192 of the EC Treaty .
As Mr Prodi knows , this new article added to the Treaty by the Maastricht Treaty gave Parliament the right to request the Commission to submit legislative proposals .
That is a very good example , but what happened to the other five ?
It seems that the Commission has not responded .
There is no obligation on the Commission to respond , but we would expect the Commission , in a spirit of cooperation with Parliament , to look at these proposals carefully and to respond in most cases .
One out of six is simply not good enough .
We now have an Intergovernmental Conference looking at the Treaties again .
I say to the Commission , if you do not want that article to be amended further then you must take your responsibilities under the existing article more seriously .
I would urge the Commission in future , when Parliament makes a legislative proposal in this way , to take it up , at least in the majority of cases if not in all of them .
Mr President , the Commission has submitted a promising work programme for the year 2000 .
We cannot do other than give this programme our full backing .
However , there are also some unfortunate gaps in it .
There is one gap in particular I would like to discuss ; it is one Mr Jarzembowski touched on just before .
I do not see the work programme make any mention whatsoever of tourism .
We are talking about one of the most important branches of industry here , both within the EU and beyond its borders .
We have long been promised measures for this sector .
It requires improvement as a matter of urgency , but nothing is happening .
But the Commission has other important tasks to perform besides those of a legislative nature .
As Mr Poettering has already mentioned today , it also has a pivotal role as guardian of the treaties .
With that in mind , the Commission - I say this in view of the occasion - has taken upon itself the task of monitoring the activities of one Member State in particular very closely .
As a citizen of the country in question , I do not object to this modus operandi .
Nor will my homeland have a problem with subjecting itself to European scrutiny in matters of human rights , the rights of foreign nationals , and anti-racist policy .
On the contrary , we have shown in the past that our country has one of the best records on all these points , and we intend to keep it that way .
If the Commission is to be the guardian of the treaties then please , Mr Prodi , be thorough in your work .
I have " and so on and so forth " written down here , but I hope that things do not continue in this vein .
Hence I urge the Commission to uphold its role as guardian of the treaties in these matters too , and to remain vigilant .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for this clear , practical , substantial debate .
The only thing I would ask is that you view my speech as just part of an overall debate which is taking shape day by day .
There has to be a break .
Today , concern was expressed over the length of the list of subjects to be put to the vote .
Well , in my opinion , today was the right time to deal with the list and the right time for in-depth analysis .
Of course , certain areas are missing from this list .
Many of you have rightly expressed the opinion that tourism is a subject which is missing , which , as has been said , is a larger employer than agriculture .
Of course , we must turn our attention to this matter , although , as you are aware , the Commission ' s powers in this area are rather limited .
In any case , the list contains many subjects , the details of which will have to be discussed in committees .
There is therefore a series of issues on which we must work together this year .
However , we also have a major opportunity , which was welcomed by a great many of you today , in that our economy looks set to be sound for at least two or three years .
We must make the most of this opportunity , since , as you have pointed out , we have a major problem with our budget .
Today ' s speeches reveal a precise , but ruthless analysis .
In addition , it is vital for Parliament and the Commission to work well together to make these decisions .
I am fully aware of this .
Last week , I met with the official representatives of the German Länder to discuss this issue , and we did not confine ourselves to decentralisation at all : the discussion went much deeper than that .
We talked about the levels of governability which need to be adopted in Europe , not decentralisation ..
It is for this reason that I have continued to push for a White Paper on governability .
We are in the process of creating something completely new .
And in order to do this we must work together .
Each year , we present a report on the actions we have undertaken .
In February , we presented an annual report on the actions carried out in 1999 , which we would like to expand .
It already covers all the actions carried out , but we would like to provide more information on our current work .
These are the plans for a great European Union , plans with a specific objective .
If we do not implement these plans there will be no place for us in the new world .
A criticism was made of globalisation , which to me is absurd , for globalisation is already underway . The problem is rather how to accomplish it .
Do we want to play a leading role in this globalisation ?
Do we want behave responsibly in respect of developing countries and the Third World in this matter ?
I feel that this is an extremely important strategy .
There is an obvious need for a collective conscience which will take care of the whole world and not just our own particular interests .
Woe betide us if we try to halt globalisation , for it is the one remaining hope for Italy , for China , for the world which is trying to develop in this global economy .
We cannot stifle these countries at such a decisive moment as this .
This , therefore is our destiny , and our task is to create a Europe which is increasingly able to play a proper role .
And enlargement is a part of all this : it is not just a means of preserving peace , it is a means of defining our role .
To sum up , this overall balance , this sense of mission , this feeling of compatibility which guides the actions of every Parliament and every government , must preside over enlargement , the budget , and governability .
Mr President , I put an extremely topical and extremely precise question to the President of the Commission about his view of the relationship between freedom of expression and responsibility for cooperating loyally with the institutions .
Unfortunately , I did not receive any answer to this question .
It is a question which is being debated everywhere in Europe at the moment , and we should be extremely interested to hear his view .
No , not this time either !
Thank you very much , Mrs Thors .
The President of the Commission has given his answer and we must now continue the debate .
I have received five motions for resolutions , pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
Cocoa and chocolate products
Mr President , chocolate was the topic of a stormy debate at first reading . This was justified and not without results .
Justified because the original proposal focused exclusively on the internal market .
The Commission only took a passing interest in the quality of the product and had no consideration whatsoever for the ethical and legal obligations we have towards developing countries .
The discussion was not without results either .
Upon serious analysis of the common position , it has to be said that democracy works .
We did not sit passively on the fence , muttering under our breath , but took a pro-active approach in tabling amendments .
Should we assent to other legislation ?
Fine , if that is what is to be done , but could we do so on our terms , please .
We only wanted tropical fats ; the common position provides an exhaustive list of them .
We wanted double labelling , the common position has given it to us , only it would have been preferable to have the additional designation on the front of the packaging .
We wanted an impact study .
We are getting one , two and a half years after the directive has entered into force .
We wanted the Commission to draft an amendment proposal , if need be .
Well now , the Commission will need to do so and we can then amend it again if necessary .
We did not want comitology for essential amendments .
We are getting codecision .
And we asked for more precise measuring methods ; in my opinion , the Ispra research institute has acquitted itself of this task quite admirably .
Many of us in this House were displeased with the Commission proposal .
Even if none of the amendments survive , the result is still worth seeing .
I would like to finish off with the following thought .
In the debate on chocolate , the word ethics was used more than once .
To me , ethical behaviour also implies that , if this House scored a victory , we should be able to say so and underline this .
If a victory is achieved , one should be able to enjoy it too .
Perhaps we ought to learn to do this one day .
Mr President , it has taken us twenty-five years to come to the point of a common position which represents a real compromise .
I want to pay tribute to Mr Lannoye .
He is a parliamentarian of considerable skill , and he has argued his case throughout with force and conviction .
But he undervalues his own contribution to this debate , because it is what he has done and others have done that have led us to a position which can be fairly regarded as a compromise .
They do not want to see the addition of vegetable fats anywhere , in any Member State , in any form , for anything called chocolate .
The amendments that came before the Environment Committee , with the exception of the few that were passed , were wrecking amendments .
They were designed to postpone , for the lifetime of this Parliament and the lifetime of this Commission , any resolution of this issue , and that is not acceptable .
They called for impact studies to come into force before the directive itself can take effect or all manner of additional labelling over and beyond the double labelling on the packet which is provided here for the consumers .
My Group supports the common position with some exceptions , and they will all make themselves heard in this debate .
We believe that this is good for consumers . They get a wider choice of product and separate and distinctive labelling .
It is good for the manufacturers of all the vegetable fats and I include cocoa butter in this .
The last point that I have time to make is to the producers of quality chocolate by the specialised methods we see in Belgium and some other areas .
Quality argues for itself .
You can have additional labelling if you want .
People like me will continue to eat it , but we want people to have the widest choice of all the products which will expand the import of cocoa and added vegetable fats into the European Union .
Mr President , the average citizen who hears about this debate on the chocolate directive will lick their lips at the thought of feasting on all kinds of delicacies .
After all , chocolate is also considered a stimulant , unfortunately .
This agony will come to an end today .
There are many interested parties in this discussion : the cocoa producers , the producers of vegetable fats , non-governmental organisations , chocolate producers and many more .
They are all interesting in their own way , but most interesting of all is the consumer , in my opinion .
The most important principle is that of the consumer ' s freedom of choice .
We politicians need to show some prudence in this respect .
After all , there is no accounting for taste .
The European Parliament cannot and should not prescribe a harmonised euro taste .
As far as we are concerned , there is no need for warnings in flashing neon letters on the front of chocolate packaging .
After all , chocolate is not exactly a product like cigarettes .
There are , of course , other interests which need to be taken into consideration .
For example , we need to be aware of the precarious situation of the countries where the ingredients for chocolate originate .
Prudence is called for once again .
After all , there are conflicting interests involved .
The countries that Ivory Coast exports cocoa to also import other competing ingredients from countries such as Mali and Burkina Faso .
The Council ' s common position as it is now before us attempts to accommodate all these interests .
We feel that it is lacking in one or two areas .
The best that can be said of this compromise is that none of the parties involved have been indulged completely .
There are no winners , but there are no losers either .
Most members of the Liberal Group can tolerate this precarious balance .
We therefore support the common position and believe that the directive should be adopted as soon as possible .
Let us proceed with the order of the day and put chocolate to its intended use , namely enjoyment .
Mr President , Commissioner , since we cannot reject the directive on chocolate which is , as it stands , unacceptable , Parliament is duty bound , at the very least , to improve it .
In the first place , we must ask ourselves what is the relevance of this directive which is going to change the definition of chocolate .
The European Parliament must be aware that the Codex Alimentarius , which dictates the composition of chocolate internationally , stipulates that it is made from cocoa butter .
In authorising the addition of 5 % of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter today , the European Parliament is opening the way to many other impostures .
What is there to stop us , in future , describing oil to which palm oil has been added as olive oil ?
In the second place , if the text of the common position goes unchanged , then consumers will be needing a magnifying glass in order to examine the composition of chocolate products .
Finally , as producing countries , already aware that cocoa prices are today at rock bottom , we are in danger of making them collapse completely , if we adopt this position .
In order to avoid chaos in producing countries , the European Parliament must demand an impact study on the export situation .
I therefore call upon you to support all the amendments presented by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
Mr President , Commissioner , as all chocolate-lovers know , proper chocolate is made from cocoa butter .
The addition of any other fats spoils the flavour .
Indeed the 1973 directive , which prohibited the use of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter , was intended to safeguard this quality .
With the inclusion of new countries in the European Union , some derogations to this strict ban came to be granted .
Harmonisation was essential in the name of the free movement of goods .
At first reading , Parliament got involved in a dangerous procedure of accepting the directive subject to certain conditions .
The Council leapt into the breach , adopting its common position , which recognises the designation ' chocolate ' even for products with other vegetable fats added .
Once again we see the concept of profits for the few triumph over quality for all .
At second reading , however , the European Parliament can thwart this directive which would have serious implications if it were applied .
Both consumers and small specialist chocolate-makers would suffer a reduction in quality and standards would be reduced to the lowest level .
ACP cocoa-producing countries would experience a considerable reduction in their market and their income .
This would involve more than USD 300 million for the Ivory Coast alone .
To say that they are extremely worried is an understatement .
We have therefore tabled a motion to reject the Council ' s common position .
The small specialist chocolate-makers came to warn Members of Parliament at January ' s part-session in Strasbourg .
So , I ask all the Members who declared their solidarity with them to support our motion .
Mr President , consumer protection is our prime concern .
The issue of the directive on the production and sale of chocolate is thus just as important .
The European Union must lead the way in simplification , confidence , authenticity and respect for differences .
Since 1973 , European legislation has stipulated that the designation ' chocolate ' must be given to products containing only cocoa and cocoa butter .
Some Member States have enjoyed a derogation from this law since acceding to the Union .
That is fine , let everyone have their own chocolate bar in their own home .
This labelling frenzy is admittedly necessary since there has been a loss in confidence , but , ladies and gentlemen , if you give up a specific definition of chocolate , then at least do so clearly and openly .
I therefore urge you to support Amendments Nos 29 and 18 .
Tastes are certainly culturally conditioned .
If you yield to the compromise , then a foodstuff will be admitted into our territory which is described as ' chocolate ' but which is not chocolate , as far as we are concerned .
We are defending the concept of authentic chocolate .
Cocoa butter is the very essence of chocolate . Let us respect the guarantee of flavour that it offers .
It is not enough to publish a White Paper on food safety in order to reassure consumers .
We are condemning an entire sector of specialists and SMEs if we accept any other definition of chocolate .
Today ' s vote is a symbolic one .
We must prioritise information for consumers and the interests of African cocoa-producing countries , associated to Europe under the Lomé Convention .
Surely scheduling an economic impact study years after the application of a directive belongs to the realm of the absurd ?
We want none of your compromise chocolate , we are too familiar already with the Federalist recipe .
' Entente culinaire ' between peoples is a difficult issue , it reflects our differences in too clear and practical a manner , and does not work towards all-out harmonisation .
You should know , ladies and gentlemen , that making Europe tasteless will not contribute to its popularity .
Mr President , for centuries , cows have eaten grass and chocolate has been made from cocoa .
Then , a few years ago , Great Britain , which gave the world meat served with jam , hooligans and Adam Smith , started to feed cows on cadavers and to manufacture chocolate without cocoa .
The checks are pointless in any case , as we are told that the margin of error is 1 % , whereas scientists tell us that it is in fact 40 % .
We are told above all to ' eat and drink without fear , you are protected by the label ' .
Yet the label is a deception in graphic terms because it is illegible and a hypocrisy in scientific terms because the mention of ' palm oil ' , for example , is drowned among the list of ingredients .
Just as in the case of port we are not told ' South African counterfeit ' , for cocoa we are not told ' counterfeit ' .
Then , lacking arguments to justify the chocolate fraud , the multinationals say , ' You must accept 5 % , or there will be wholesale fraud . '
What then ?
All you have to do is call the product ' shea-late ' if it is made from shea nuts , or ' soya-late ' if it is made from soya , but not ' chocolate ' .
The 388 000 tonnes of French chocolate , for example , must be made from cocoa , and the French turnover of FRF 19 billion , for example , must be earned honestly by small specialists .
It is also a financial obligation .
If we do not fulfil it , then we shall be forced to compensate for the losses in these countries under the Stabex system .
It is an obligation in terms of health and food safety , since the substitutes for cocoa , such as Brazil nuts , may cause immunological reactions .
Finally , it is a question of honesty , of morality .
Mr President , Commissioner , genetically modified organisms and mad cow disease were not enough to temper the enthusiasm of those involved in food manipulation .
Humans are continuing to play the sorcerer ' s apprentice , juggling with food safety .
Here , courtesy of industrial lobbying , we have chocolate with added vegetable fats .
Its cocoa content is going to be reduced by 15 % but it is still going to be entitled to the designation ' chocolate ' .
This is the crux of the problem .
There is a clear lack of transparency , and yet we distinguish butter from margarine .
There will perhaps be a discreet entry , in small letters on the back of the package , indicating its new composition .
There will be deterioration in the quality , of course , but also in the flavour , and the goods are clearly not what they are represented as being .
This is unfair competition , with this ersatz , pseudo-chocolate being sold cheaper than pure chocolate manufactured by craftsmen with proper respect for authenticity , ethics and tradition .
On the other hand , it represents a cause for concern among small specialist chocolate-makers and also developing countries which are cocoa producers , whose compensation is being seriously considered .
Finally , there is one major problem , while today we know how to detect vegetable fats in chocolate , we are still incapable of identifying and quantifying them .
There is , therefore , no traceability and the door is open to all sorts of abuses .
As far as we are concerned , the use of the designation ' chocolate ' should be prohibited for any product which contains ingredients other than sugar and cocoa .
We must not mislead the consumer by giving the name ' chocolate ' to just anything .
Europe must not become an accomplice in cheating , in the manipulation of food , at a time when food safety is becoming one of its priorities .
Europe must not adopt the lowest possible standards .
It must ensure the quality of food products and consumer health .
In the light of these principles , we are unable to endorse the aims of this directive .
Rejecting it would represent a strong message to our citizens and a responsible attitude adopted by Parliament .
This is the thrust of our amendment . If not , when will we see wine made without grapes and butter without cream ?
But is this actually true ?
I will start with the information for the consumer .
The Commission has freely admitted that there is no foolproof detection method .
The margin of error is 2 % .
At 5 % , this is even 50 % more .
This seems to be unacceptable to me .
Furthermore , inspection depends on the type of chocolate and the information which the producer wishes to provide .
We are not taking ourselves and the consumer , in particular , seriously if we introduce a directive which we cannot monitor adequately .
I would now like to comment on the third-world interests . It concerns me greatly that both those for and against the common position keep bringing up the same arguments .
Those " for " claim that the common position will benefit the third-world counties while those " against " say that more than 1 million farmers in western Africa stand to suffer from it as a result .
Which is it and which will it be ?
Is it really asking too much to want to check what the effects of this directive will be on , for example , export and the sustainable development of cocoa-producing countries ?
Finally , ladies and gentlemen , I really need to get something else off my chest .
Rightly or wrongly , it is said that this Parliament should not accept any amendments at the risk of jeopardising this delicate compromise .
Well , if that is the case and if that is an argument , I suggest we pack our bags and go home now .
Each common position always strikes a delicate balance between national interests , environmental conditions and social considerations .
Mr President , one of the joys of spending time in Belgium and France is the pleasure of these countries ' chocolate .
It is wonderful , but millions of people in Europe also enjoy the British product . None of them come to any harm in the process .
Whatever its content they are happy to call this product chocolate .
It is insulting for us to play semantic games about the definition of this word .
The citizens we represent are not fools .
They can tell the difference between different varieties of chocolate and they have to be allowed to decide for themselves .
I have no doubt that this compromise will help the overall market increase .
Mr President , on the present issue I represent a minority of the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left .
I consider that there is really no need for this directive and that it is unnecessary .
I think it is absolutely excellent that we should have different rules about chocolate in different Member States .
In this area there is no need for harmonisation at EU level . Instead , the previous system can be retained .
In that way , you can still have both sorts of chocolate and choose which you want to buy according to personal taste or national tradition .
The alternative , that is to say of prohibiting other vegetable fats , means also prohibiting a large quantity of chocolate products which people like and are used to eating .
I think that is completely unnecessary .
Nor is it certain that the Third World , all in all , would benefit from other vegetable fats being prohibited as added ingredients .
For one thing , other tropical fats such as shea butter would be treated unfairly , and certain countries would in that way suffer .
For another , the total market for chocolate products would probably decrease and thereby also , perhaps , the level of consumption of cocoa butter .
My conclusion is that I should ideally like to see the old arrangement maintained , with different rules in different countries .
However , since that is no longer possible , I think that the common position is acceptable .
Mr President , in many ways , I think that we are about to end up with a good compromise on the directive relating to cocoa and chocolate products , thanks especially to Mr Paul Lannoye ' s efforts .
I am very much in favour of clear labelling .
There are absolutely no objective criteria for saying that , and the Council is quite rightly leaving it to consumers to judge the quality .
We must not forget that shea nuts are just as essential to the countries which export them as cocoa is to the cocoa-exporting countries .
Any future investigation of the effects of the present directive upon developing countries ' exports ought therefore also to include both cocoa and shea nuts .
What , for me , is most important of all is that there must be no enzymatic or genetic modifications to the vegetable fat in chocolate .
A ban of this kind is the only means through which we can give developing countries a guarantee that they can go on at all exporting the goods which they produce by natural means .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is a known fact that chocolate made from pure cocoa butter induces a state of euphoria .
The same cannot be said for this directive which we had absolutely no need of .
Nor , surely , can it be said of this chocolate adulterated with vegetable fats recommended by the Council , which unfortunately did not follow the European Parliament ' s recommendations at first reading .
Indeed there would be a great deal to say about the attitude of some delegations within the Council .
Today ' s consumer has had enough of being deceived .
What is the Council putting forward to solve the problem ?
A tiny piece of difficult-to-read information , hidden on the back of the product wrapper .
This is not what we are asking for . The consumer will not be able to make an informed choice .
We want the information to be obviously and clearly displayed on the front side of the product wrapper .
This is what we achieved in the European Parliament at first reading .
We know that the cost of the fats capable of replacing cocoa is much less .
That is why big industry is so much in favour of them .
Making things cheaper and cheaper : what image of Europe does that present ?
No matter nowadays what the consumer wants , what the consumer ' s preferences are , no matter the fact that public opinion wants ever greater transparency !
Who today can claim to be able to monitor this infamous 5 % of vegetable fats which would replace the pure cocoa butter ?
Nobody .
So what is to be done ?
Let us , fortunately , trust our SMEs , the small specialist chocolate-makers , who are going to have to work on a quality label .
This is what the consumer wants .
And let us , most especially , support our rapporteur , Mr Lannoye .
Thank you very much , Mrs Grossetête .
Welcome
We shall all do our utmost to ensure that the visit by Mr de Croo and his colleagues is a great success .
Cocoa and chocolate products ( continuation )
Mr President , Mr De Croo , after debating for 25 years , we are gathered here once again to discuss chocolate , such a polemical debate for such a sweet subject .
We are talking about harmonisation , the harmonisation of tastes , of habits and , almost , of cultures .
In short , chocolate is a dividing factor and the divisions are neither ideological nor even national , whatever some parties might think .
What makes defending cocoa-producing countries an ideological matter , I ask you ? It is an ethical matter .
In terms of the social aspect , we are talking about millions of families who make their living from cocoa production .
We have made formal commitments to them .
So what is the reason for this time limit ?
Sixty-six months to carry out a study of the impact of this directive , such a time period is enough to cause irreparable damage to the export structures of these countries .
The potential impact must be investigated in advance , that is clear .
Any other sort of harmonisation would mean lowering standards and that is not the sort of Europe that the consumer wants .
Mr President , rules make sense if their purpose is to protect people against the power of money , against health risks and against poverty .
If the European Union lays down rules governing the production of chocolate , then these should be geared to protecting the cocoa farmers in the third world , especially in Africa .
Rules are also important to protect consumers against genetic modification and against the addition of unexpected substances .
Lastly , rules are important to protect expertise and craftsmanship within Europe .
What is now threatening to happen is at complete odds with this .
Should free trade be granted absolute priority ?
This may fit in rather well with the development currently taking place within the European Union .
The price to be paid for this , by African farmers in particular , is too high .
I value the attempts made by Mr Lannoye to keep these negative developments within bounds , but it would be better still to continue to offer full protection against the processing of other products and cocoa butter .
Whilst I respect the commitment of the rapporteur to his cause , I suggest to the House that is nonsense .
Mr Lannoye says that he has gone back to retable some of the original amendments .
I suggest to the House that this is not a time to go back - this is a time to move on , to move forward .
This is a single market issue ; this House should not be standing in the way of the completion of the single market but should be actively promoting it .
If I could share one brief historical fact with the House concerning my own country : the first mention of solid chocolate being sold in the UK was in 1657 when a Frenchman opened a shop in London .
Mr President , 25 years ' discussion of the great existential issues surrounding chocolate and what it is and is not makes the European Union as an institution look slightly ridiculous .
The present debate has perhaps given me , as a war child , a certain insight into how things were when the peoples of Europe were killing each other for values symbolised by rather more important things than chocolate .
After all , this is not a product which is a threat to people ' s health .
Neither Scandinavian , Belgian nor British chocolate is dangerous .
It is not a product which affects the environment to any great degree .
The whole issue is therefore somewhat ridiculous .
Where is the benefit in that for the Third World ?
Mr President , we are in no position , here in the European Parliament , to state that one type of chocolate is better or worse than another .
Nor can we say that one kind tastes better and another worse .
Rather , we shall leave it to the individual consumer to judge which kind tastes best and is of the highest quality .
Consumer choice is the basic principle of the market economy and , as politicians , we should not be instrumental in running a kind of nanny State .
Malta ' s former prime minister , Dom Mintoff , attempted during the 1970s to reduce chocolate imports and to alter the way in which chocolate was consumed by tourists and by his own people .
With Chinese help , a chocolate factory was built on the island , but consumers did not like the locally produced chocolate and chocolate consumption fell .
Let us not , therefore , make the same mistake as Dom Mintoff .
The proposal that information about the contents of certain forms of chocolate should be provided on the front of the packaging is discriminatory and completely unjustified .
It would be more like the kind of warning you find on cigarette packets .
The chocolate war has been raging within the EU for 25 years .
It has made ourselves as politicians and the EU as an institution look faintly ridiculous .
In the future EU , too , and within a society characterised by diversity , there must be room for two traditions of chocolate manufacture .
We now have the opportunity to bring the 25 year-old European chocolate war to an honourable end for all the parties concerned .
We ought therefore to adhere precisely to the common position .
Mr President , I am Belgian and I am not opposed to the common position .
If the chocolate which I love so much were to be at risk or if the tradition of Belgian chocolate manufacturers were to be in danger , then I would , of course , be opposed to it .
I bought some chocolate here in Strasbourg this morning and the French sales assistant explained to me quite clearly what exactly I was buying .
The designation on the front of the product states : Prestige noir intense 72 % cacao and in gold lettering , which , in France , is quite something , chocolat belge .
So I know what I bought .
In my opinion , the pending directive will make it even easier for producers of quality chocolate to set themselves clearly apart from the others if they so wish .
I do concur with the rapporteur on one point .
The producers of cocoa beans , namely the small farmers in the poor third-world countries , are vulnerable .
So let us now deal with this matter once and for all and ensure that everyone can eat the chocolate they fancy and that a real internal market can be established for chocolate .
Mr President , the common position on cocoa and chocolate products is the result of long and involved discussions .
It constitutes a delicate compromise which was difficult to achieve but which is well-balanced .
Through the common position , the free movement of cocoa and chocolate products was introduced , but with strict conditions governing production and consumer information .
It is permitted to add vegetable fat other than cocoa butter to the minimum quantity of cocoa required in accordance with the Directive , but no more than five per cent .
Only those substances listed in the annex may be used .
They are all of tropical origin and produced in ACP countries .
The presence of these substances must be indicated separately but in the same area of the packaging as the product name and list of ingredients .
Consumers will then be able to choose and to distinguish these products from those which are manufactured exclusively from cocoa .
These conditions and restrictions , which are not linked to health issues , are the fulcrum of the common position .
The common position also provides answers to the questions and concerns of consumers , of cocoa-producing countries and of countries which produce chocolate , with or without vegetable fats .
Any change would seriously upset the balance of the agreement which the Council has agreed upon and would be doomed to fail .
Parliament ' s recommendation on second reading contains two amendments .
The first amendment reiterates the Commission ' s policy , and this can be approved .
The second amendment may nonetheless be approved in principle .
There must be a more thorough examination of the consequences of these amendments against the background of the World Trade Organisation ' s pronouncements and the Montreal protocol .
The other amendments , which were rejected by the Commission ' s Directorate-General for the Environment , concern questions of special significance to the balance of the common position and cannot therefore be approved .
The common position involves a real compromise and is a clear advance on the legislation currently applicable . This hails back to the 1970s and is very incomplete , especially when it comes to labelling and consumer information .
To summarise , it is only Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which may be approved , and this for the aforesaid reasons .
- ( PT ) Mr President , I rise to speak on a point of order concerning the need to uphold the respect due to the European Parliament and its Members .
One of the Members who spoke in this debate was Mário Soares , who also supported the resolution adopted by a majority of this House .
These unacceptable statements by the Angolan Government not only affect Mário Soares . They affect all of us who adopted the resolution in question .
- ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my total agreement with the speech that Mr Queiró has just made on this subject , and to introduce another element into the discussion .
During the last part-session , in February , a debate was held on the situation in Angola and a resolution was adopted by this House .
Mr President , we all have the right to express our opinions in this House and in a democracy .
We may agree with something or we may not .
What is unacceptable is that a state that maintains relations with the EU should be allowed to respond by attempting to undermine the dignity and honour of a fellow Member of this House .
My question is , therefore , whether the President of the European Parliament has already responded to the Angolan Government through its Ambassador in Paris ?
If it has already responded , what was the tenor of its response ?
Ladies and gentlemen , I understand the political , institutional and compassionate motives behind these speeches .
In future , I will keep you informed of the decisions taken , or not taken , by our President , and of the activities for which she gives the go-ahead on your behalf .
I would also like to make it quite clear , however , that as regards the European institutions , this is not only a matter of ensuring that the European Parliament issues a protest and a repudiation .
This House therefore clearly repudiates Angola ' s attitude and hopes that the EU Council Presidency will also clearly voice this repudiation and will not remain silent in the face of these accusations .
I would like to thank Mr Queiró , Mr Seguro and Mr Pacheco Pereira for their speeches .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Vote
Mr President , I regret causing some slight complications as regards the order of business of the plenary .
Following consultation with other members of the Committee on Development and Cooperation I appeal to you to postpone the voting on this regulation until tomorrow .
There are basically two reasons .
One is that the deadline for a request for separate votes on the amendments should have been made by 7 p.m. yesterday .
Because of a misunderstanding that request was not made in time .
To pursue the voting as a block vote today would , to my mind , be unfortunate .
The other reason has to do with comitology .
We would benefit from additional discussions among party groups on certain details in relation to some of the amendments .
Hence , I would ask you , as rapporteur , to follow my recommendation for postponement .
( The vote was postponed until the following day )
Just to repeat what my colleague , Poul Nielson , stated yesterday , the Commission 's position on the amendments is as follows .
( Parliament approved the common position ( as amended ) )
Amendment No 6 :
Mr President , I just wanted to point out what repercussions a split vote would have .
Normally , it is customary in parliamentary circles to vote on the most in-depth proposal first and then to move on to the less in-depth .
Due to this split vote , we are now voting on the least in-depth first and are working our way up to the most in-depth .
( Parliament approved the common position ( as amended ) )
( Parliament approved the common position ( as amended ) )
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Recommendation for second reading of the Fernández Martín report ( A5-0048 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted in favour of the common-sense considerations on the ecological disaster which threatens our planet if current developments continue .
These concerns are , however , drowned out in a hotchpotch of irresolute declarations .
Neither the Brussels Commission nor the European Parliament have any desire to act or even clearly name the parties responsible for these disastrous ecological developments .
.
( FR ) The text of the report before us today fulfils the need to conserve tropical forests .
The European Union and its Member States in fact have some responsibility for the conservation of an ecosystem which is essential to the environmental balance of the entire planet .
This responsibility is a historical one , primarily , and is related to the commitments made by Member States to the countries where the bulk of the tropical forest is located .
These historic links and expert knowledge must be made to serve the conservation of this ecosystem .
Our responsibility also stems from our status as consumers : many consumer products in Europe come from these regions and generally have an adverse impact on the forest .
Finally , the European Union actually includes large areas of tropical forest within the territory of its Member States , particularly France .
The department of French Guyana , in particular , is almost entirely covered by this type of vegetation .
In particular , the important thing is to enable real development in these areas , while respecting the culture and traditions of the inhabitants , without setting them in stone in a purely passive ecological conservation mode .
The European Union can make a contribution in this field if it can manage to coordinate efforts and know-how without seeking to control or foist a single strategy on Member States .
We have therefore backed the amendments of the PPE-DE , which support the flexibility necessary for the whole system .
Recommendation for second reading of the Bouwman report ( A5-0043 / 2000 )
In the jungle of maritime transport , such behaviour is , unfortunately , frequently encountered .
It helps to make refuse sites of our seas and beaches , and to jeopardise the ecological balance of the marine environment .
We can only applaud the proposed European directive which would make it possible to apply these principles .
At the same time , however , we wish to ask the important question , which is : what is to become of the inspections ?
The proposal envisages that vessels docking in a Community port may leave again only on presentation of certificates proving that the vessel ' s waste and cargo residues have indeed been disposed of in the appropriate installations .
But what about vessels from outside the Community ?
Will they also be asked for certificates ?
And how will vessels that pass through our waters without docking into port be inspected ?
We think that , to begin with , access to Member State ports should be banned for vessels which do not present such certificates , even if they are from outside the Community .
Furthermore , the Member States , who , under the directive , are to make the commitment to step up in-port inspections , must also undertake to intensify their systems for inspections at sea .
We know only too well the pressure of competition in maritime transport .
There is no point in adopting conventions or directives if they are subsequently to remain dead letters for lack of inspection resources .
Let me remind you that the proposed directive which we are discussing today is intended to improve the availability and the use of port waste-disposal facilities for operational waste and cargo residues .
It is totally in keeping with the 73 / 78 Marpol Convention ( Prevention of Pollution from Ships ) , while concentrating more particularly on the waste-disposal facilities in ports .
It forms part of the overall Community strategy for waste management and requires all ports to provide appropriate waste-disposal facilities , adequate for the needs of vessels .
Today we face maritime pollution problems , which we must tackle head-on by adopting bold measures .
The fact is , as the rapporteur points out , that regulations already exist , but they are not observed .
The system generally applied is the one governed by the ' polluter pays ' principle , a principle which is outstanding in terms of its inefficiency !
This is why we need to find an alternative .
Such an alternative is offered to us in an amendment which I supported .
The amendment seeks to establish a system of charges which all vessels would have to pay systematically each time they dock in a port , whether or not they make use of the waste disposal facilities .
These charges would be used to finance the relevant installations up to 90 % .
This system would inevitably encourage vessels to dispose of their operational waste and cargo residues in port rather than degassing at sea , a deplorable practice which is commonplace nowadays .
Everyone knows that some vessels even took advantage of the pollution caused by the wreck of the Erika to discharge their waste at sea .
This is absolutely scandalous and intolerable .
There are , however , examples of good practice , because the countries around the Baltic Sea have already been operating in this way since 1998 .
I am well aware of the fact that this would cause upheaval in the organisation of the ports of many Member States and would entail additional costs for vessels .
This system seems a fair one to me , and I therefore voted in favour of it .
- ( FR ) This proposed directive is most welcome within the European Union .
It forms part of the overall Community strategy for the reduction of marine pollution and for waste management and requires all Union ports , including yachting marinas , to provide appropriate waste-disposal facilities suited to the requirements of vessels .
International regulations were already in existence , since the Marpol Convention imposes binding international regulations upon all vessels , according to which all discharges at sea are prohibited .
The real problem , however , is the application and observance of these standards !
The fine ' polluter pays ' principle , so dear to many Member States , including my own , is far from being complied with !
The Erika disaster is testimony to this unfortunate state of affairs , as are the thirty-nine instances of degassing which went unpunished in the space of a single week !
We feel that this is the only realistic and fair way to prevent the illegal dumping of waste at sea .
Moreover , we wish to set the level for mandatory inspection at 25 % of all vessels .
On the eve of the French Presidency of the European Union , this is the position which the French Socialists are preparing to champion .
All I can do is urge this House to do as much .
- ( FR ) It is not possible to ignore , today , the fortuitous coincidence of the second reading of this proposed directive against maritime pollution with the topical news of the tragic wreck of the Erika .
Admittedly , this text does not discuss accidental pollution , but we know full well that the implications of illegal degassing at sea are no less serious , even if it is a more insidious phenomenon .
In the last week of February , 39 instances of illegal degassing were identified in the vicinity of the wreck of the Erika alone .
Such practices are intolerable , but they are difficult to monitor , particularly at night or in foggy weather .
Subject to this condition , then , what this directive proposes is Europe ' s initial model response to the legitimate feeling aroused due to the pollution caused by the wreck of the Erika .
To some extent , it marks the official acknowledgement and establishment of a European maritime area subject to shared regulations .
For all these reasons the UEN Group , recalling its agreement with the Council ' s common position , is now opposing the text of this report which has twisted the principles of the common position .
Recommendation for second reading of the Piecyk report ( A5-0040 / 2000 )
- ( FR ) The European Parliament has today expressed its opinion of the proposed directive on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles .
It is indeed essential to improve the level of safety and to mitigate the environmental impact of these vehicles , the volume of which is constantly increasing .
Setting up random mandatory roadside inspections in order to check their state of repair throughout the year is a pertinent idea , provided that it can be implemented effectively .
It is also important , as a matter of urgency , to consider having recourse to alternative means of transport for goods ( waterways , railways , etc . ) and to consider developing clean vehicles .
These are the reasons why , ladies and gentlemen , I supported the proposed directive on the technical roadside inspection of commercial vehicles today .

EU Charter of Fundamental Rights
The next item is the report ( A5-0064 / 2000 ) by Mr Duff and Mr Voggenhuber , on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , on the drafting of a European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Madam President , the committee proposes to place a Charter of Fundamental Rights at the centre of the Union system , with mandatory effect upon the European Union , its institutions and the agencies .
We do this because there is a great concentration of power at the centre of the Union and it is clearly necessary for the citizen to be protected from abuse of that power .
This resolution mandates the European parliamentary delegation inside the Convention .
The Convention has already started the process of drafting the Charter upon the principal lines that we propose and upon the presumption that the final result will be binding .
A strong vote for this resolution will assist the Convention to complete its task and set criteria for this Parliament ' s final appraisal of the results .
We should avoid becoming obsessed with the question of subsidiarity .
The drafting of the Charter will certainly be informed by the application of that principle , but it is crucial that the Charter reflects modern European society with all its pluralism and with all its diversity .
The effect of the Charter will be steady and gradual rather than sudden and revolutionary .
There is also a controversy over the relationship between the new European Union Charter and the existing European Convention of Human Rights .
We are proposing that the Union should itself sign up to the ECHR so that those rights inscribed in the existing Convention would form the solid core of the Charter .
Madame President , our purposes are to write a charter that is so good that Member States will find it shameful to refuse to accept it within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice .
I strongly commend the resolution .
.
What I mean to say is that I hope that the damaging amendments made by those who see in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights an attack on democracy , no less , will be rejected .
What is there to fear in a Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
The European Union means the peaceful , supportive coexistence of different peoples and cultures , based on its tradition of respect for the rights of individuals .
There will have to be acknowledgement of the political rights of citizens and the human rights of every individual person . Fundamental rights will have to be defined in the face of fresh hazards .
A catalogue of fundamental rights which are recognised as binding by the European institutions also sets out the duty of the citizens to respect them .
The site of clashes between opposing armies throughout the whole of the first half of the century , Europe is now on the way to becoming a guarantee of peace and freedom from fear and want .
This is how we must see the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
There is no reason for anyone to be afraid when the prevalence of rights over force is enshrined in the law .
Madam President , Europe is founded upon fundamental rights .
So is the American Constitution , namely upon our fundamental European rights and the ideas of John Locke and the French Revolution .
American citizens can demand our European rights in their own courts , something which has provided them with empowerment , self-assurance and a pride in themselves .
Fundamental rights can create identity and citizenship .
The assets we have as Europeans in the form of cultural differences are easier to maintain and to accept if citizens know that they can claim their rights throughout the Union .
Quite simply , freedom of movement demands a basis of guaranteed , fundamental rights .
Enlargement of the Union without guaranteed rights could even turn into a fiasco and delay our economic development .
A binding Charter is an indispensable requirement and a necessary part of a much-needed constitution .
I want to warn against joining the Council of Europe ' s convention , especially if this step were not to be combined with a binding Charter .
These complications ought to be studied more closely .
The Charter should be easy to communicate to citizens and be clear to them .
It should not be divided into two or contain a whole lot of references .
The Charter must be binding and embrace the European institutions .
It cannot be fair for citizens to be left without protection against abuses by institutions resembling police forces , such as OLAF and Europol .
This project will give rise to more powerful European individuals .
Madam President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I will mainly focus on the issue of social fundamental rights .
Social fundamental rights form part and parcel of traditional fundamental rights .
For example , what use is the right to freedom of expression to someone who , owing to poverty and unemployment , suffers complete social exclusion ?
There are social fundamental rights which , by their very nature , are identical to and , as such , simply form part of , the traditional civil freedom rights .
There is , for example , the right of organisation and association which can be extended to the right of free negotiations on working conditions and the right of conducting collective action .
These rights should therefore be included in the first part of the charter .
In the case of other social fundamental rights , there should be a link between the way fundamental rights are worded and the effects thereof on the individual .
These fundamental rights are thus often described as instruction standards which are implemented by authorities in social legislation .
These are , however , no less essential to the charter as basic elements .
Quite often , this category of fundamental rights keenly shows up the misconceptions people have as to this charter ' s significance at European level .
This is not the case at all .
No more so , in actual fact , than is the guarantee of freedom of expression or a fair hearing .
The purpose of the charter is to incorporate these fundamental rights in the European institutions and European policy .
This is , in fact , a reaction to a second common misconception .
It is not the case that the charter would only contain rights for which the European Union would be the first authorised port of call .
Even where the Union has no authority at all , policy measures which may be taken by or on behalf of the European Union can still infringe fundamental rights .
Accordingly , fundamental rights which cannot be guaranteed at EU level but can be violated by the Union , belong in the charter .
I would also like to comment on international treaties with regard to social fundamental rights .
The opinion of the Social Committee lists a few of these treaties : the Council of Europe ' s European social charter and the ILO ' s and UN ' s core Convention .
Another amendment , regarding a more far-reaching alternative , Amendment No 23 , stipulates that the ECHR , as well these social international standards should be acceded to .
Madam President , I would like , above all , to congratulate all the rapporteurs on the quality of their work .
They have successfully stated the importance of this matter for the European Parliament , Europe and its citizens .
The area of competence of the Committee on Petitions justifies its interest in the framing of the charter .
The large numbers of petitions which it receives make it possible to assess the citizens ' perception of the Union and the rights they expect it to protect .
The opinion of the Committee on Petitions is intended to bring to light the aspirations expressed by the Europeans who refer their cases to Parliament in matters of non-observance of rights granted by the European Union .
So our opinion stresses two key points which the rapporteurs , moreover , seem to share .
Firstly , the necessary visibility of the charter as a point of reference for the citizens .
This necessitates clear and concise drafting within a single , comprehensible text .
Secondly , the binding force of this charter , which is achieved when it is possible to defend the recognised rights in the law court .
The natural outcome of this determination is the inclusion of the future charter among the Treaties .
In conclusion , let me say that it is necessary to make a qualitative leap in the protection of fundamental rights .
This report must be a unanimous message from Parliament to ensure that the Council and the Convention respond to the expectations of petitioners .
Madam President , no doubt the Council would like to hear the opinion of the political Groups , which seems to me to be very healthy .
Madam President , we are holding this debate at exactly the right time .
The convention which is drafting the Charter on Fundamental Rights has begun its work and I believe that we are already doing so at cruise speed .
We are dealing with the content involving civil and political rights , and then we will deal with citizenship rights and economic and social rights .
The representative of the Committee on Petitions is right to point out that the citizens often ask us what this Charter of Fundamental Rights is for .
Fundamental rights are recognised in our constitutions .
The Member States of the European Union respect fundamental rights .
There is a Rome Convention , upheld by the Court in Strasbourg , which is the ultimate guarantee in the event of a violation .
So what is this Charter for ?
I believe that Parliament should send a very clear message : the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a supplement to these rights guaranteed in the constitutions .
Being European has an added positive effect .
By means of this Charter we intend to bind the European institutions to a bill of fundamental rights and to bind the Member States to those same rights in their transposition and application of Community law .
Being European is a positive thing . It adds to what we already have as national citizens .
The report which we are debating today and voting on tomorrow also seems to explain very clearly what the political objectives of this Parliament are .
We do not wish the Charter to be a mere declaration .
We do not believe that a declaration is sufficient .
We want the Charter to be incorporated into the Treaties precisely because we want the citizens to have more rights and guarantees .
Whether or not the Charter is incorporated into the Treaty clearly depends on the work which the convention is able to carry out .
It will depend on whether the work is useful and can be incorporated into the Treaties .
However , it seems to me essential that Parliament bears this objective in mind with regard to the drawing up of the Charter .
It is also important to state , as this report does , that absolutely no harm will be done to the protection of fundamental rights as laid down in existing provisions .
There will be no double use of the Convention of Strasbourg . We should make this very clear .
I repeat that what we want is to provide the European citizens with a supplementary guarantee when it comes to the application of Community law .
I believe that , by affirming the indivisibility of fundamental rights , as this resolution does , or affirming their innovative nature , we are taking positive steps towards an improvement in the living conditions of the European citizens .
Madam President , I would like to end by whole-heartedly congratulating both the rapporteurs and the draftsmen of opinions .
I therefore hope , Madam President , that tomorrow ' s vote will support the rapporteurs ' good work with a massive vote in favour of this report .
This is the background against which we are working .
A European Union charter : this clearly means that the charter is addressed to each and every one of our fellow citizens , admittedly , but also to persons resident in or visiting the Union .
That is important to note .
The charter must contribute to this .
It is intended , rather , to say what Parliament expects of the convention .
To this end , I should like to stress two points .
In the first place , what do we expect to obtain from this exercise ?
We want more than this .
It is in this spirit that we are working within the convention , both in terms of the timetable and the form .
My second point is to do with its content .
Our resolution does not say much with regard to content , but Parliament has already had , on at least three occasions , the opportunity to state what it expected from a charter on fundamental rights .
Let me state here the extent of the difficulty of the mandate given us at Cologne , acknowledging social rights which would be nothing more than goals .
Finally , I think that the European Parliament will be on the right track for the charter to be ready , in terms of both content and timetable , to be integrated during the French Presidency .
Madam President , the need for a binding charter is more a political than a legal issue , but this does not detract from its significance .
Fundamental rights are of secondary importance in treaties these days .
If they are included at all , this is done so in a completely chaotic format .
This is unacceptable , certainly if Europe professes to be a Community of values .
Therefore the charter must guarantee the citizen protection against the breaches of increasingly widening supra-national legislation .
The ECHR should apply as a minimum standard with specific European Union rights added to it .
Needless to say , we need to do everything possible to leave national constitutions intact as much as possible but it cannot be ruled out that it will affect these constitutions .
After all , the charter must be able to form the basis for new fundamental rights if so necessitated by social developments .
Finally , Madam President , it is essential for the European Union to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights , for Strasbourg must become stronger , not weaker .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be an essential stage in the construction of Europe .
We must provide ourselves with the means to make it the founding element of European identity , allowing Europe to make the qualitative leap it needs in order to feel that it really does exist .
The future charter must be included among the Treaties and this must be achieved on the occasion of the next IGC , probably the last with the current fifteen countries .
France , the self-proclaimed home of human rights , must absolutely take advantage of its presidency during the second half of 2000 in order to table this amendment of the Treaties .
This is a formal request which we are making to the French Government .
There are , however , two points that I would like to mention here .
Firstly , I should like to stress the need for the charter to develop the concept of European citizenship due to residence .
More than ever , it is essential to avoid the coexistence in Europe of distinct classes of people enjoying distinct rights .
This charter must make every effort to develop our definition of European citizenship based on the idea of residence .
The rights that we are defining , if they are to be fundamental , must be applicable to everyone .
Secondly , I should like to stress the urgent need to include effective protection for personal data held on computer within the scope of the charter .
Last month , the European Parliament in fact adopted an amendment asking for a Committee on Information Technology and European Liberties to be set up .
Well , this cannot truly exist unless it is based on a solid legal standard .
The charter must therefore ensure that it defines the limits of the content of files , the means permitted for data retrieval , and access methods .
This is a major issue for the guaranteeing of fundamental freedoms in the twenty-first century .
So , for the time being , what I am about to say applies only to the Duff / Voggenhuber report .
There are three reasons for our claiming that the charter , as envisaged , would curtail the rights of citizens .
Firstly , on the pretext of defending citizens better , it would distance them from the place where their rights are defined .
It would weaken the control that they currently have over it .
Next , the charter would provide a new pretext for the frenzied standardisation of citizens ' rights in Europe .
Indeed I am astounded that governments are prepared to allow this to happen .
Here we are at the heart of what we have called the process of reducing rights .
It is perfectly feasible to imagine , as of the end of the year , candidate countries signing up to this charter in order to demonstrate their inclusion in the circle of European values .
If so , adhesion to the charter could be shared by both existing members and future members .
Every country must continue to be able to choose its regulations freely in accordance with its own culture and development .
We would like the Intergovernmental Conference , which is just starting , to keep the essential principle of respect for national democracies continually in mind .
Now then , the European Union does , in effect , seem to be a little behind , but we can make up time by using this vessel .
I am referring to it as a vessel because it is obviously still only a framework . We do not , as yet , know what we will put inside it .
The report does , of course , contain some of the main points , but we will have to decide upon the definitive text later on .
This Charter is important because , although we do have other conventions and treaties , human rights are always under threat , even within the Union .
The right of citizens to vote for whomsoever they choose should be respected indiscriminately for all people at all times , without sabotaging the governments and countries which emerge as a result of these elections .
In our opinion , however , we should be moving towards a Europe of peoples , peoples whose identity is not necessarily defined according to the present form of the Member States .
In particular , certain rules of some of the penal codes should be altered , such as article 141 of the Italian Penal Code , which goes so far as to punish acts of secession with life imprisonment .
Madam President , as the low turnout during the most recent elections has shown , " Europe " as a concept does not mean a great deal to its citizens .
We cannot change this by giving citizens a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Citizens need to see that the European institutions are actually acting in their interests and are not just out to increasing their own power .
If this happens , confidence among people will grow more than could ever be achieved by many a fine declaration or charter .
We do not share the presumption that a comprehensive charter can be drafted which comprises all current fundamental rights .
Such a document cannot be drafted , not now or in future , and this ambition is certainly not a task of the European Union .
What we should aim for within the Union is cooperation based on respect for the separate identities of peoples and states .
Fundamental rights must be secured where they can be protected as effectively as possible and where they can be embedded in the social fabric , that is to say within the Member States .
It is also vital that the ECHR ' s external supervisory role in the protection of fundamental rights remains intact . Equally , the authority of the Court in Strasbourg over this whole procedure should remain unaffected .
A legally binding charter will inevitably affect fundamental rights provisions in Member States and will undermine the role and the authority of the ECHR and the Court in Strasbourg .
If a charter were to be drafted nonetheless , we would strongly urge that this only apply to the institutions of the Union .
It should only include articles which can give a meaningful message to these European institutions .
Vague instruction standards or rights in policy areas , where the Union has no authority , must be omitted .
Finally , fundamental rights are based on human dignity .
The true value of human life , however , will never be fully understood if we lose sight of God , the Creator of all things , including man .
Mr President , dismayed as I am by the fact that 14 Member States have prejudged Austria , I regard the proposed Charter of Fundamental Rights as an opportunity to bring the European Union closer to the people .
I therefore welcome it .
In drawing up this Charter , the Union wishes to demonstrate its respect for the rights of the people and to show that it cares about the welfare of the individual .
Likewise , the impression has been created that 14 Member States have failed to play by the rules they themselves adopted , and have violated their obligations towards solidarity .
The decision taken by the 14 has done great damage to the perception that the citizens of the European Union have of Europe .
And I believe it is very doubtful indeed as to whether this damage can be made good by a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Mr President , for years now , the European Parliament and our group have been asking for a proper description of fundamental rights of the European citizens in the European treaties .
The request was made at the time of the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Amsterdam .
In this connection , I would also remind you of the report which I had the privilege of writing in conjunction with Mrs Dury in preparation for the Treaty of Amsterdam .
This question was raised in that document too .
In fact , it was in this document that we achieved our first successes , for our anti-discrimination clause was used in the Treaty of Amsterdam virtually verbatim .
Later on , at the Cologne Summit , Parliament ' s wider request was also honoured .
A meeting was proposed for the purpose of producing a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen .
The question which concerns us today , more than anything is : what should this charter contain and what legal force should it have ?
We should not produce empty shells ; our citizens would see through them straight away anyway .
As far as the content is concerned , the charter must tie in with the existing conventions , such as the Council of Europe ' s European Convention for the protection of human rights .
In fact , in my opinion , the Union should sign up to that Convention without delay .
It should not duplicate what is already there .
New threats , in particular , will need to be anticipated , such as in the field of information and biotechnology , and in the protection of the environment , of which man forms part .
I will probably submit a text on this matter myself .
Mr President , I would just like to say a few words on the question of the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties .
The governments , and , on their behalf , the Council of Cologne , left the question open .
They left a question mark over whether and how to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties .
We feel that the Intergovernmental Conference is our opportunity to resolve this question , and this opportunity must not be passed up .
There are , so to speak , two parallel operations .
It is the responsibility of the Convention to prepare the draft Charter in time for the Intergovernmental Conference to be able to decide whether to incorporate it into the Treaties .
In this regard , I would like to warn the representative of the Council , the Portuguese Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , that the Intergovernmental Conference should already be starting to prepare for this eventuality .
If the Charter is ready in time , the Intergovernmental Conference will have to define the procedures for its incorporation into the Treaty .
As we are all aware , from the European Parliament ' s perspective , this should represent a step towards the constitutionalisation of the Union .
I am quite aware that the term ' constitutionalisation ' has come to be viewed with some suspicion recently , and that people are afraid to use it , or at least , prefer to avoid using it .
From time to time I find myself in difficulties , because the parliamentary committee of which I am Chairman has changed its name from the ' Committee on Institutional Affairs ' to the ' Committee on Constitutional Affairs ' .
And yet I feel that this is the right way for us to go and that it does not in any way mean promoting that concept we all fear of a European superstate .
Nothing can undermine the value of the national constitutions , in the same way that , according to the Treaties , European citizenship does not replace national citizenship , but incorporates it .
Ladies and gentlemen , human rights are a constitutional issue .
Mr President , I should like to express my substantial agreement with the point just made by Mr Napolitano .
It is , when you think of it , odd to suppose that great institutions of this kind could be thought capable of existing without some constitution .
Manifestly we do exist and therefore manifestly we already have some kind of a constitution .
The question is : do we have an adequate constitution and what kind of constitution do we want ?
To say we need a constitution is not to say that the European Union should have the constitution of a state , for the Union is not a state and is not about to become one .
We all therefore agree that there should be proper recognition of rights within the Union and that this should be binding on the organs and institutions of the Union .
The EU organs and institutions can exercise far too much power to permit them that power without the proper control which a Charter of Rights would imply .
There is however one risk .
One of the great success stories of Europe is the way in which the European Court of Justice , especially when other institutions were blocked , succeeded in building the concept of Europe as a Community under the law .
If we create a Charter of Rights that overloads the Court of Justice , that has everybody beating a path every week to Luxembourg , we will destroy the purpose .
We must ensure that the main avenue for protecting rights is in the national courts and in a supervisory jurisdiction as exercised at European level .
If we do not succeed in that , we will fail in everything .
In that way , a loophole has appeared in connection with fundamental rights , and this loophole should , of course , be closed .
In our eagerness to make things right , we are , however , in danger of doing a lot of damage .
The EU is faced with a number of choices . Are we to secure our own rights ?
Are we exclusively to look after ourselves and our own ? Or are we to reinforce human rights throughout Europe ?
The EU must not start competing with the existing authorities for resolving disputes , such as the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg .
That would , of course , weaken the latter and damage the situation regarding human rights throughout Europe .
In my view , the EU ' s Court of Justice should therefore be kept away from the project concerning fundamental rights .
In that way , the EU would reinforce the existing conventions , and that is something there is a need for .
I would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the two rapporteurs despite the fact that I do not agree with everything that they have set down and suggested .
At the same time , they have been given an impossible task to try and square a circle that cannot be squared .
In the brief time that I have , I would like to concentrate on one specific point which the previous speaker has mentioned , as indeed have other speakers .
That is the potential conflict which could arise between this Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights .
Over the last 50 years , the European Convention , with the decisions of the Court , has grown and evolved to accommodate new rights , new entitlements and new freedoms that have developed with society .
Also , in case Members do not know it , under a strict legal interpretation any EU legislation supersedes any constitutional provision or any other national legislative provision in any one of the Member States .
Therefore , if this Charter were to be incorporated into the Treaties , it would supersede the European Convention on Human Rights , it would supersede any national constitutional provisions and would also supersede any national legislative provisions .
It is a pretext , when the very title of the proposed charter speaks of the fundamental rights ' of ' the European Union instead of fundamental rights ' within ' the European Union .
Forgetting the people , social democrats hide , shamefaced , behind human rights and furtive liberals turn into social democrats .
But the people take note of these recantations and will , one day , reject them , or indeed the Western world will come to an end .
It certainly is not useful , as has been claimed previously , in terms of improving or strengthening human rights within the construction of Europe .
Is it to be citizenship in the way that we traditionally understand it , with rights which characterise in a specific way the people belonging to a given community ?
Mr President , while I congratulate the rapporteurs on their work I fear that , as the road to hell is paved with good intentions , so it is with this Charter .
The nations of Europe can be proud of their record on human rights ; however , have they needed charters ?
Of course , there are exceptions , exceptions so serious that Europe has a responsibility to do what it can to ensure that the inhumanities and atrocities of the past are never repeated .
But does this Charter add to what we already have ?
Why not a simple declaration of human rights under Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty without the need for a charter for litigation ?
Can fundamental rights properly be protected by a court which is already overstretched and frequently arrives at its judgments long after the events which it is judging ?
Does this Charter simply aim to be an expensive distributor of compensation in the dreadful fullness of time ?
Ensuring fundamental human rights is the best of intentions , but a charter for litigation and bureaucracy is surely another road to another hell .
Mr President , why do we need such a Charter ?
The big question is not whether we need such a Charter but what status it should have .
Some have argued that the Charter should simply gather together in a readable form all the rights that currently exist within the European Union .
This would be a valuable exercise : there is clearly a problem of awareness of people 's rights .
Many citizens do not know the rights that exist today .
A document clearly laying out such rights , and making it clear where and how these rights could be exercised , would be valuable .
But if that was all we were doing in the Convention then we should have left it to a team of academics , who frankly could have done it better than a group of 60 politicians .
So the Charter must fill in any gaps in existing rights , and it must be binding on the institutions of the European Union .
However , it is clear that not all rights will be equal , at least in the way they are implemented .
The rights need to be in two categories .
What is clear , and what unites most people in this Chamber who want such a Charter , is that it must be in the Treaties .
If it is to impact on the citizen it must appear in the Treaties of the European Union .
I hope that this position will be retained in tomorrow ' s sitting , as it will be vitally important if we wish to avoid confusion with the many various schemes in respect of fundamental rights .
I would like to raise the issue of reinforcing the political rights of citizens with the help of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
In my view , there has not to date been so much discussion on the subject .
Citizens can mainly stand as candidates in elections and vote in another EU country .
But why should we not establish some new institutions and instruments , by means of this Charter , enabling citizens to have a real influence ?
Why can we not look to the future and see that it will be ever more important for our citizens to be able to take part directly in decision-making in other ways too ?
I think it would be natural for this to form part of the Charter and very little has been said about this so far .
During this past century , Europe has experienced two terrible wars , immeasurable tragedies , but , at the same time , it has witnessed unrestrainable civil , cultural and social progress .
The working masses fought , and achieved and consolidated positive results which protected their rights , and which , at the same time , played a decisive role in the development of democracy .
First and foremost , a document such as this cannot fail to include a specific , indisputable reference to the right to work .
It cannot and must not be without this reference .
For this reason , therefore , I ask Parliament to approve the small number of explicit amendments tabled by Mr Kaufmann and myself on this subject .
For this reason , we are against it .
We are not questioning the content of such a charter .
We come from a country whose constitution contains one of the most extensive enumerations of fundamental rights anywhere .
We also belong to a party that was forged in the struggle for democracy , and one of whose greatest concerns has always been the steadfast promotion of human rights .
We do not think that it would be correct , and certainly not appropriate , to impair and disturb the balance of the Treaties at present .
There is a very simple reason why the European Union does not need a Charter of Fundamental Rights : it does not have a fundamental rights problem .
The Europe to which we belong is even , to a certain extent , the cradle of the culture of fundamental rights .
As there is no problem , the charter is not a solution and as the charter will solve nothing , it is therefore a problem in itself .
This is not a plus , but a minus .
The appropriate setting in which to enshrine fundamental rights is the constitutional law of each nation state .
The appropriate setting for achieving international legal harmonisation and solid advances in the international protection of human rights is the agreements and conventions ratified by the Member States in as wide a geographical area as possible .
In other words , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and , in Europe , the European Convention .
This would ensure that they were clearly incorporated into the acquis communautaire .
That would be a real step forward . This charter is the wrong answer to a problem that does not even exist and is therefore an additional problem which we feel we can do without .
So reads Item B in the motion for a resolution we have before us .
I consider it to be great progress that the European Parliament has specified and established a view of human beings which is deeply rooted in Europe ' s history , culture , popular movements and spiritual traditions .
In our capacity as citizens , we have freedoms and rights , but we also have responsibilities .
I therefore welcome the fact that responsibilities have been incorporated in accordance with my wording in Item E.
I would also remind you of Amendments Nos 24 and 25 which the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats have submitted and which will be voted on tomorrow .
This statement totally conflicts with the UN ' s and the Council of Europe ' s fundamental human rights charters concerning the rights of the family .
Mr President , it is not often that one has cause to simply feel glad about something in the all too ponderous run of things in the European Parliament .
However , the report by Duff and Voggenhuber has given us cause for this today .
I would particularly like to take this opportunity to highlight how doggedly they have pursued their goal .
Duff and Voggenhuber , on the other hand , think of themselves as true European Parliamentarians whose task it is to further the interests of Europe as a whole .
This Charter will only meet the needs of the citizens of Europe under two provisos . Firstly , it must be given substance , and secondly , it must be made binding in law .
However , it is stunningly disappointing to note how the Convention , which has been specifically set up for this purpose , is high on competences but very low in courage .
And so really , this report could also be viewed as an appeal to the Convention that goes like this : ' Dare to do something at long last !
Dare to include innovations in the Charter , particularly those in the sphere of information and biotechnology , but also where equal rights for women and environmental protection are concerned .
The Charter is precisely the instrument we need to give Europe a soul , and it could help create a common identity .
Why is it that EU governments are so quick off the mark when it comes to pushing through economic reforms but so hesitant when it comes to political rights ?
Do you not realise that Europe as we know it will fall apart if we put all our efforts into bringing on the economy and do not do anything to promote political fundamental rights ?
Conscious of my position as an Austrian , I would therefore like to make the following appeal to the national governments : ' wake up , it is in your own interests to give fundamental rights a chance !
With this in mind , I hope the report in question achieves an overwhelming majority in plenary tomorrow .
I should like to say that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is both welcome and essential , provided it does not fall into the following three traps .
The third danger is that it may become a general Charter containing a loose set of average values , a mechanism for subverting the advanced human rights which have been acquired in various countries .
For example , if a particular country has the right to free education , then any general reference to the right to education in a European Union Charter could be the first step towards subverting that right .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , fundamental rights , citizens , freedom and human rights have a long tradition in Europe .
The fact that fundamental rights have come to be guaranteed under constitutional law over the past 200 years is largely down to the impact these universal documents of fundamental rights have had .
It is now the task of twenty-first century Europe to combine the existing fundamental rights in the Member States and those aspects that apply to Europe .
The fundamental rights such as freedom of worship , freedom to meet and form associations , for example , are sacrosanct and inalienable rights to freedom from state intervention .
Applied to Europe this means that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights must protect the citizens of the European Union against the interference and intervention of European institutions in the fundamental rights of the citizens .
Furthermore , our group hopes that a written European catalogue of fundamental rights will put European integration on a firmer legal-ethical footing and help to create greater transparency and clarity for the citizens .
Our group deems it particularly important that the European Charter should neither replace nor infringe Member States ' own provisions on fundamental rights .
There has been heated discussion over the call for the European Union to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms drawn up by the Council of Europe in 1950 .
The Council of Europe ' s Convention is now 50 years old .
At the same time , however , this means that we must confine ourselves to the traditional fundamental rights and avoid extending the scope to social and economic fundamental rights , which are not legally enforceable at European level .
I would like to thank the rapporteurs for the comprehensive work they have done , and hope that the deliberations of the European Parliament find their way into the Convention ' s discussions on the elaboration of fundamental rights .
Mr President , the rapporteurs Duff and Voggenhuber , as well as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , have done some sterling work .
The report itself is sound because it conveys the key messages without going so far as to anticipate the work of the fundamental rights convention .
I therefore nurture the hope that tomorrow in plenary sitting , this report will be adopted in the form we in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights drafted it in .
However there is one point which I would like to be amended .
I have tabled an amendment to this effect on behalf of my group .
It concerns the question , raised repeatedly today , as to whether the European Union should sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights .
This was an important goal in the past .
But that is not the path we want Europe to go down in the future , and nor should it .
With all due respect for the Human Rights Convention , we need more !
We need our own Charter that provides our own answers to the questions raised by the age we live in .
The European Convention on Human Rights does not fulfil this task .
It is not in a position to do so because it came into being in the 50s , when political and social conditions were completely different .
Seen in this light , it is time for all of us to call for constructive work to commence on our own Charter .
We call upon the Convention on Fundamental Rights , the 62 politicians that David Martin mentioned , to take up this task .
Let us support them in this .
In other words , policy should be implemented along the lines of a directive rather than a regulation .
We do it differently and no less effectively .
Mr President , for those countries which have a long tradition of directly , legally binding charters , a development of the kind proposed is not dramatic .
This means that family values in society are falling into the wrong , or at least biased , hands .
The new right is getting hold of them and using them to capture the moral high ground .
That is why the theme is tiresome to so many .
However , I believe that it would be a big mistake for the European Parliament to approve of this sort of trend .
Families are firmly connected with the European notion of society .
Like many others , the Christian Democrats want a society where freedom and responsibility meet halfway .
I see it as a family society because it is difficult to learn about joint responsibility and solidarity if it is not learnt in a small , close-knit community .
Society may be just , but it cannot ever love .
Its bosom is too cold and its arm too short .
Nevertheless , it is this very love that is a requirement for the healthy development of the individual .
And a progressive Charter of Fundamental Rights will be of no use to Europe if the members of its society have no wish to respect them .
Social development with that end in sight still takes place in the family .
There can thus be no people ' s Europe without a family-oriented Europe .
Families need recognition , encouragement , freedom of action and protection from social tyranny just the same as individuals do .
Family rights and protection that have been provided for in legislation elsewhere in this respect should be reproduced in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
It is good to remember that Europe has shared a common position throughout its history regarding the importance of supporting and protecting family and marriage .
This is enshrined in all our constitutions as well as the constitutions of those accession countries joining the European Union in enlargement .
I can show you the constitutions of post-communist states in which the family and marriage is protected .
I welcome the reference in our Charter to family life .
Part 1 of Article 9 states : " Everyone shall have the right to found a family " .
Society recognises marriage not on moral grounds but because it recognises on a rational basis the stability it affords society socially and economically as well as securing future generations .
The Union should only step into a primary role where the family is unable to fulfil its duty .
A question that has already been asked here today is what makes us want to join together and to transcend our enormous diversity by creating an entity which will unite us all .
This is the key question as regards European identity , and it goes to the very root of why we are also joined together here , in this great home - the European Union .
Over the decades , and having survived all kinds of traumas and crises , we have established a way of life based on the values of liberty , democracy and respect for the rule of law .
The ascendancy of these ideas and the end of the totalitarian era which marked certain European societies has created a new situation to which we must respond .
In our opinion , this is a question of responsibility and also of consistency .
This is not the case , and that is not the purpose of all this .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is nevertheless not intended to act as a substitute for the constitutional guarantees that we all enjoy in our own countries .
No , we intend to provide something which will bring added value , a kind of additional guarantee , which would function as an instrument of the new European citizenship .
Here , Mr President , we must overcome certain problems which the debate within the Convention is beginning to run into and which I think it will face even more frequently in the future .
The first issue regards jurisdiction . It concerns the need to guarantee complete compatibility between the two relevant legal systems , which could find themselves in conflict with one another in this process .
This is a real problem and one of which we should all be aware .
We cannot run the risk that when this charter comes into force a new area of legal uncertainty will be created .
We are embarking upon an exercise designed to make our citizens ' rights more transparent - not to ensnare them in a web of legal contradictions that could prove to be a source of confusion .
This also brings us to the issue , which has surfaced once again following Amsterdam , of the Union possibly signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights .
This is a fundamental question .
The third question , and a crucial one , is the body of rights .
How far do we intend to go ?
How far is the Union prepared to go ?
But unless it is binding , will any Charter of Fundamental Rights be anything more than a mere statement of principles , without any real value ?
On this subject , I should like to mention the issue of the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is obvious that the issue of incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a crucial factor for the whole credibility of the ICG .
Once again , the Commission would like to make four key points quite clear to Parliament .
The truth is that the Commission , as stated in Paragraph 14 of the resolution tabled by the European Parliament , takes the view that the legal force of the charter should be determined by the Nice European Council .
It must be taken by the European Council , when it decides on the legal force of the charter .
The Commission advocated this as long ago as 1979 and did so again in 1990 .
The idea that the European Union itself ought to sign the European Convention is also largely shared by the European Parliament .
I would also like to clearly state a second idea .
There is no inherent contradiction between the Union having a Charter of Fundamental Rights and , at the same time , signing the European Convention on Human Rights .
Furthermore , I recommend that you carefully read the contribution of the observer representing the European Court of Human Rights in the Convention responsible for drafting the Union ' s Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I would like to make two more observations on the list of rights .
The Commission would like to reiterate that it is favourable towards the idea of a charter encompassing both civil and political rights , as well as social rights and rights deriving from European citizenship .
Lastly , I would like to say that in our opinion , the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is not intended to replace either national constitutions or the European Convention on Human Rights .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Vitorino .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Additional Commission contribution to the IGC
The next item is the Commission communication " Additional Commission contribution to the IGC on institutional reform : qualified majority for taxation and social security aspects of the internal market " .
I am not very sure , given the joint , or parallel , organisation of our work , how I shall be able to do this properly .
I did mention before this House our intention to outline and clarify some aspects of this opinion at a later date .
We had identified five categories of exceptions to the general rule which we approved , according to which , within the Union , decisions would henceforth be taken by qualified majority vote .
We had , however , identified , for institutional reasons , with regard to extremely serious or sensitive issues , five categories of exceptions requiring unanimity .
This was one of them .
We had also excluded decisions incompatible with the objectives of the internal market or which may give rise to distortions of competition .
This is the point we have discussed today in order to complete our opinion .
These proposals concern the methods for decision making in matters of taxation and social security .
Having said that , I should like to clarify three misunderstandings which sometimes arise . Firstly , the Commission is not demanding new jurisdiction for taxation and social security .
Ever since the Treaty of Rome , the Treaties have provided for Community action in both these areas .
Switching from unanimity to qualified majority is not a transfer of jurisdiction .
The Commission is keeping strictly to the areas of jurisdiction which are already available to the European Community .
Let me take VAT as an example. in this matter , we are confronted with an important part of Community legislation which has been developed since the 1970s .
It is only the method of decision making which may change .
This is the first point that I wished to make clear .
The second point I would like to make is that the Commission does not wish to impose the levelling of national tax systems or social security systems .
The matter we wish to deal with is how to maintain what already exists and share it with all the new Member States .
It is a case , then , of introducing qualified majority where we think it necessary , and leaving unanimous decisions where they are preferable .
Finally , the Commission wishes to make it clear that this additional presentation does not encompass its entire programme for years to come in all areas .
It does not include the measures that the Commission may envisage for the future , or the basic proposals that it intends to put forward at some point .
My fellow Commissioners , Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Bolkestein , will inform you when the time comes regarding the various aspects of the Commission programme .
I should now like to mention the principles which oriented our approach in the document which you are to receive shortly .
Let me say again , unanimity is to remain the general rule .
The Commission therefore considers it justifiable to retain unanimity in these areas as a basic principle .
We confirm this approach . Moreover , these national choices are generally - let me specify - generally , neutral with regard to the construction of Europe .
This is the first principle .
But this first principle gives rise to a second , which is as follows : qualified majority to enable measures to be adopted which are more directly linked to the proper operation of the internal market .
We know , and you know , that some national legislation in the field of taxation and social security may , by virtue of its content or nature , have repercussions for the operation of the internal market .
The Commission considers that the Community must be able to adopt , by qualified majority , those measures which are most directly linked to the proper operation of the internal market .
That is the second principle .
Finally , my third principle , we must in future select the best instrument to respect subsidiarity .
It may simply be a matter of coordination ; it may be a matter of establishing minimum requirements ; it may also be a matter , at a higher level , of harmonisation .
But this selection of the best instrument must be limited to that which is strictly necessary .
Generally speaking , the end goal of measures for which the transition to qualified majority is suggested would not be to harmonise the national legislative systems systematically , but simply to coordinate them .
This is in any case , ladies and gentlemen , what has been going on for almost forty years in the field of social security .
We also consider it important to introduce it to the field of taxation too .
Still , before answering your questions , I would like briefly to mention the content of the proposals as you will read them .
Regarding direct taxation , we propose the qualified majority in order to coordinate the campaign against fraud and tax evasion and in order to ensure proper handling of situations involving the legislations of several Member States .
For the remainder , unanimity shall remain the general rule .
We further propose to retain unanimity for decisions on tax rates and the points of taxation .
We must avoid penalising them .
Mr President , let me just say one final word to explain the state of mind I have continued to work in , as we had done under President Prodi in adopting our opinion on 26 January .
The Commission undertook to carry out clear , proactive work .
We eliminated any ideological thinking .
We wish to keep to specific facts and tangible proposals in order to avoid approaching matters with slogans or ideologically .
Mr President , firstly I would like to welcome the Commission 's approach in general to the IGC .
The fact that we are getting this rolling presentation of more detailed explanations of issues is very helpful .
Secondly , I agree with the Commission that this is indeed an extremely delicate issue .
Taxation and social security get to what Mrs Thatcher used to call the nooks and crannies of everyday life .
It is something that affects Member States and their people in a very sensitive way and we have to be careful before the Community moves into these fields .
From what I hear , the Commission has got it more or less right and I would like to put a couple of questions for the sake of clarity .
That makes absolute sense .
What I was not clear about was when he talked about other measures where it was necessary to make the single market work .
How will that be defined ?
It sounds fine but how do you define a measure that is essential to make the single market work ?
That is a matter of intense debate .
Similarly , the issue of harmonisation against coordination : one man 's coordination can be another 's harmonisation and we need clear definitions of what is coordination and what is harmonisation if this is to work .
I wish him well in this area because it is an area in which we need a breakthrough .
Thank you , Mr Martin , for your assessment . I understand that it is related to the detailed analysis that you will make of the Commission text .
The text will , as soon as it has been adopted - as is now the case - be made available towards the end of the afternoon .
Just now , ladies and gentlemen , I expressed my concern in this document , and in the discussions we will be having , to avoid ideology , to keep to a precise approach .
So let me repeat that our watchword was to say that qualified majority should be extended to everything that directly affected the operation of the internal market and which might compromise its proper operation in an enlarged Europe .
We have , of course , worked on the three instruments which I mentioned , coordination , minimum requirements and harmonisation , treating harmonisation as the additional stage .
Further to this general answer , with thanks for your remarks , I shall be attentive to your criticisms or your proposals when you have had time to peruse this document .
To quote but one example : the country of origin principle in matters of VAT .
Would it not be possible to start by making adjustments to the current VAT systems , so that harmonisation systems can be implemented more efficiently at European level ?
Or another example : double taxation , which causes so many problems .
My question is this : will the Commission ' s work programme include a schedule for this , or how do you intend to proceed ?
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your comments .
I do not understand your assertion that there will be no transfer of powers .
If you are increasing qualified majority voting and therefore taking away the national veto , you are effectively transferring powers from the nation state to the European institutions .
Are you aware , Sir , that the leader of the British Conservative Party has said that we have reached the limits of European integration ?
Are you aware of recent public opinion surveys showing that the British people are opposed to the transfer of further powers from the nation state to Brussels , and how will you take those facts into account ?
Commissioner , I should like to pick up on a point which you made in your speech .
You said that wherever we require unanimity , we shall retain unanimity , and wherever qualified majority voting is required , we shall use qualified majority voting .
We all know of course that the European Parliament takes the clear view that qualified majority voting must apply as the rule and unanimity as the exception .
If we forego this practice , then we also forego the subsequent promotion of the European Parliament to colegislator on all future legislative issues requiring a qualified majority .
Mr Rübig , in answering I shall focus on the matter of VAT .
Nonetheless , you have asked me , broadly speaking , whether the great VAT modernisation project might be adopted with your proposals by qualified majority ?
I must answer that it depends what you mean by ' great VAT modernisation project ' .
Jointly with the Member States , we are currently identifying what should go into this package .
A meeting was held on 2 March but , frankly , I think it is rather too early to be able to give you any further details .
But what will happen in a much enlarged Europe , where disparities are even greater than they are at present in social terms and budgetary matters ?
This is why we recommend an extremely thorough , and I might almost say clinical analysis of these matters , in the interests of the internal market .
Finally , I would like to thank Professor Tsatsos for having mentioned the connection between these proposals and the role of the European Parliament .
Since I have been given the opportunity , let me confirm that one of the Commission proposals is to associate codecision directly to all measures decided by qualified majority as soon as legislative measures are involved .
Professor , we shall have further opportunities to state this and to try to convince the other negotiators of this throughout the coming months .
Mr President , Commissioner Barnier , I am extremely pleased that the Commission has produced this initiative .
It is clear that there is a need for harmonisation of taxation policy within the internal market and the currency union .
Those who deny this call the future of the internal market into question .
You talked specifically about VAT but I did not hear you mention two other taxes that have long been the subject of discussion , i.e. tax on interest and company tax .
These are clearly two basic taxes that we are going to have to harmonise in some way .
I do not know if you included this under tax evasion ; it does not feature in your document at any rate .
Could you comment on this ?
Mr President , I have to say that I am most impressed by the principles which the Commissioner has set out .
3 , subparagraph 2 , concerning the cancellation of contracts of employment .
I have difficulty in seeing what the justification is for this on the basis of the three principles which have been laid down and which have been emphasised by the Commission .
In the light of this , may I conclude that the Commissioner does not wish to comply with the Presidency ' s note on these proposals ?
Commissioner , you are proceeding with the utmost caution , and that is an approach which I support .
With reference to the argument of subsidiarity , I should simply like to tell you that , in my opinion , it is also important to put forward the argument of citizenship in fiscal matters .
After fifty years of building Europe , it is unacceptable that the citizens of Europe should not be equal in the eyes of the law simply due to their being classed as resident or non-resident .
The concept of citizenship is common property , on behalf of which we must move beyond failures such as Helsinki .
I have three specific questions that I would like to ask you :
My first question is this : do you anticipate that the instrument you are proposing might be applicable to the integration of financial markets and the requisite tax regulation thereof ?
My second question is : does the instrument that you are proposing in the area of environmental taxation provide for qualified majority voting ?
My third question is : would the instrument you are proposing enable the Council to put an end , by qualified majority decision , to the tax havens which exist within the European Union ?
Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
It does strike very much at the heart of what is perceived as the national ability to conduct one 's affairs .
I am thinking in particular of things such as the withholding tax , which it would have been quite unacceptable to have subjected to a QMV regime .
I hope those points will be borne in mind when you look at the practicality of getting the package through .
We are very happy to combat fraud and tax evasion and to improve social security legislation , but there are some points where there will be difficulty in convincing all the Member States to follow .
Commissioner , I have some very simple questions for you , which require just a ' yes ' or ' no ' answer in each case .
Can you guarantee that the Commission will not seek , under any circumstances , to use qualified majority voting to impose the withholding tax ?
Are there any circumstances where the Commission would seek to use qualified majority voting on any of those issues ?
Can you guarantee that the Commission will not use qualified majority voting on any of those issues ?
Mr President , I can imagine that according to some Members , the citizens are sensitive to European intervention in tax and social matters .
I can tell you that in my country , many citizens lie awake at night , worrying about the fact that Europe leaves social and tax matters well alone on account of this unanimity .
This is why I would like to direct two specific questions to the Commissioner .
First of all , citizens who are very badly affected by non-intervention are mainly those who wish to enjoy free movement and , more specifically , cross-border workers .
Dossiers concerning the coordination of social security , expansion into third countries , supplementary social security systems have all been on the Council ' s table for years , untouched .
Could the Commissioner tell me if the present issue is also affected by qualified majority voting ?
I should like to answer a number of you collectively , particularly on what we might term the tax package .
Mr Leinen discussed this , as did Mr Baltas and , just now , Mrs Van Lancker .
Let me make one preliminary remark . The purpose of this speech is not , let me repeat , to foreshadow the conditions for the execution of the Commission ' s work programme .
Obviously , the Monti package is related to the proper operation of the internal market .
This is why Mr Monti , a few months ago , and now my fellow Commissioner , Frits Bolkestein , continue to make it a political priority .
Mrs Thorning-Schmidt and a number of you , including Mrs Van Lancker , mentioned the social matters which are extremely important , particularly with regard to third country nationals .
We do wish to include them as beneficiaries of social policy ( Articles 42 and 137 , which are to be subject to qualified majority voting ) .
In Nice , prior to the great enlargement , I would ask you , please , to see this text as anticipating events .
As we exist right now , we could continue to operate more or less and to live together , but that is not what it is all about .
We wish to ensure that the Community has effective means to support this restructuring at Community level .
We therefore propose that it should be possible to adopt these minimum requirements by qualified majority vote , and not by unanimity , in all the areas I have mentioned .
Finally , I should like to tell Mr Jonckheer that , for all sorts of reasons , I absolutely agree with him on the matter of citizenship .
I am aware that my answers are necessarily incomplete given the time available .
Mr Bolkestein , Mrs Diamantopoulou and myself will have the opportunity to address you again in future .
We wish to initiate this debate , and to fuel and feed it on the basis of these proposals , as I undertook , in order to facilitate to some extent , the difficult negotiations within the Intergovernmental Conference .
But , in the final analysis , as we all know , what we need is the political will .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0201 / 2000 ) .
We will examine questions to the Commission .
First Part
Question No 39 by ( H-0174 / 00 ) :
That position recalled that the fisheries agreement which expired in November 1999 applied to Morocco 's fishing zone which is defined as waters over which Morocco has sovereignty or jurisdiction .
This definition does not in any way affect the status of Western Sahara and its coastal waters .
I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his kind answer , although I find it to be completely insufficient .
The letter which I referred to in my question was very unclear as to the European Commission ' s conception of the coastal waters of the Western Sahara .
However , you have expressed it with extreme clarity ? .
There is no doubt that the Kingdom of Morocco is currently occupying the Western Sahara and this territory is currently undergoing a process of self-determination .
However , according to international law , it should be considered that Morocco has control over that territory , although it in no way has sovereignty over it .
If it cannot have sovereignty over the territory , neither can it have sovereignty over its coastal waters .
This would prejudice the future of those waters , given the possibility that the planned referendum on self-determination will support the independence of that territory .
What situation would the Government of the Western Sahara then be in with regard to the waters which it would have the sovereign duty to administrate ?
I agree absolutely that we should reach a fisheries agreement with Morocco which is favourable to the interests of the European Union fishing fleet , in particular the Spanish fishing industry .
But I believe this is not contradictory , on the contrary , with a legitimate interpretation of international law which I ask to be done formally .
Does the Commission commit itself to formally consulting the Secretary-General of the United Nations ?
Yes or no , Commissioner ?
I have many regrets in life and one of them is that I am not a lawyer , so if the honourable gentleman will excuse a scriptural reference , I tip toe on these waters with some nervousness !
But I understand that international law is quite clear and that the question of territorial waters is directly related to the question of the sovereignty of a territory itself .
That is a question which is being considered at the moment in the context of the referendum and of the UN Secretary-General 's initiative .
As I am sure the honourable gentleman knows , we strongly support that initiative and if there is any way that we can assist the UN Secretary-General , then we would certainly want to do so .
That also goes , of course , for his special representative .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions Nos 40 and 113 will be taken together , at the request of the Commission .
Question No 40 by ( H-0241 / 00 ) :
Subject : Landmines In a recent statement in the UN General Assembly the Council Presidency stated that the EU remains the main contributor to de-mining programmes worldwide .
However , people in the field complain about the limited role the EU is playing and the confused nature of EU funding for de-mining .
Could the Commission provide me with a breakdown of the funding provided by the EU for all activities relating to anti-personnel mines ?
How much money goes into mine action programmes and how much into R & D in de-mining technology ?
Could the Commission draft an annual report on its APM policy to eliminate the existing lack of clarity ?
Could the Commission tell me what progress is being made with regard to introducing a regulation on anti-personnel mines , which would provide a legal base for these activities and bring them together within a single transparent framework ?
Question No 113 by ( H-0251 / 00 ) :
Subject : EU action to combat mines Will the wide range of action programmes to combat mines have to be financed solely from budget line B7-661 , which is now more justified than ever ?
What provisions will be taken to ensure that NGOs enjoy effective access to Union funding ?
I hope you will excuse me that in answering the questions together , I take slightly longer .
I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to reply to Mr van den Bos on anti-personnel mines today .
I will also take this opportunity to respond to Madame Carlotti ' s question .
In doing this , we are responding to and building on the initiative of Parliament to create a specific budget line for mine action .
Anti-personnel mines create appalling casualties in many of the poorest parts of the world .
Over the past eight years , European Community support for mine action has exceeded EUR 180 million .
We have intervened in all corners of the world .
We have supported action by national authorities , international organisations , and not least NGOs .
We have contributed to de-mining and mine destruction as well as to victim assistance and research into new de-mining technology .
But until now , we have not had a coherent overall approach to our mine action .
The funding of mine action from the geographic programmes and their budget lines will continue .
Mine clearance and other forms of mine action are often a preliminary step to any sensible development programme .
Therefore they should form part of national or regional reconstruction and rehabilitation plans .
The new regulation and the special budget line will support and complement the geographic line by providing the overall policy framework and by functioning as a general reserve and a source for funding for international programmes .
The resources available for EU mine actions should remain at least at the same level in real terms as we have achieved over the last few years , that is about EUR 30 million a year .
Regular programmes for mine clearance and destruction under our new policy should principally benefit countries which have subscribed to the Ottawa Convention .
Finally , the European Union is recognised as one of the leading contributors to mine action within the international community .
The entry into force of the Ottawa Convention a year ago provided us with a forceful new instrument and a set of ambitious targets for the years to come .
We have signed up to the objective of eliminating all landmines worldwide in ten to fifteen years .
That will require determination , consistency and perseverance .
With the funding and coordinating mechanism under the new regulation and communication , we are well placed to take on that challenge .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply which I find extremely satisfactory .
It indicates the Commission ' s high level of commitment to this issue .
I only have one additional question , which is whether the Commissioner would submit to us an annual report on the Commission ' s actions in this field ?
- The new regulation provides for the Commission to submit an annual report to the Council and to Parliament on its actions the previous year by 30 April of the following year .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for this comprehensive answer .
Might I ask you to clarify one point ?
If the justification for budget line B7-661 were increased , what measures could be taken in order guarantee effective NGO access to Union funding ?
One thing that we obviously need to do is to advertise very clearly what is available .
We have taken a website that will enable us , I hope , to inform the NGO community and others more clearly about what is available .
We intend establishing a multi-annual work plan .
We will refer to that on our website .
I hope , therefore , that NGOs will feel involved in what we are doing .
We depend a great deal on their active support and understanding .
But overall I can assure the honourable Member that we will be involving NGOs as much as possible .
They have a great deal to contribute to this important work .
Question No 41 by ( H-0212 / 00 ) :
Subject : ' Dialogue on Europe ' initiative The President of the Commission intends to launch this initiative on 8 March 2000 .
The Commission 's communication on the subject implies that the intention is to explain the consequences of the IGC 2000 to the public opinion of the Fifteen .
Since this initiative falls under the PRINCE programme for providing information to the citizens of Europe , does the Commission intend to include the Charter of Fundamental Rights as one of the main themes of this initiative ?
The Commission considers that all the institutional matters liable to have a connection with the work of the Intergovernmental Conference should in fact come within the scope of the debate which has been initiated .
This also , therefore , applies , and this is my answer to your question , to the matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of citizens .
This dialogue on Europe will be developed with all national and regional institutions , but also with opinion formers , the media and organisations in civil society .
This is completely justified given the actual purpose of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the Commission for its reply .
I am satisfied with it for two reasons .
Firstly , it links the Charter of Fundamental Rights with the Intergovernmental Conference , which is the political objective of this Parliament expressed in the report by Messrs Duff and Voggenhuber .
Secondly , because it is going to include it within this campaign .
Furthermore , I was very pleased with Mr Lamy ' s reply - which was inevitable , given that Mr Lamy knows these issues very well - concerning the decentralisation of the information campaign .
As on other occasions , such as the Intergovernmental Conference of 1996 , this Parliament must offer the Commission its support in order to monitor information activities .
I am pleased to hear the Commissioner 's comments on the Charter .
I would like to push him to give details about the nature of the campaign .
Last Wednesday we had a very successful launch of the European information campaign involving Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament .
I would like the Commissioner to reassure me that , when the campaign is decentralised , information offices in the Member States will involve Members of the European Parliament in the information campaign as a matter of course .
After all , it is the MEPs who are supposed to represent the citizens .
We are at least as well-placed as the Commission to engage in that dialogue with the citizens .
The answer to Mr Martin ' s question is ' yes ' , and I can include Mr Barnier and Mr Vitorino in that .
The Commission does intend to involve Members of the European Parliament at grass roots level in the Dialogue on Europe initiative .
Indeed , no later than this evening there is to be a coordination meeting between the Commission administration and that of the European Parliament in order to determine the practicalities of the approach to be adopted .
The simple answer , Mr President , is ' yes ' .
Question No 42 by ( H-0215 / 00 ) :
Mr Fischler will reply on behalf of Mrs Wallström .
I should like to thank the Commissioner for his answer .
Of course , the European Parliament appreciates the Commission ' s efforts to promote Community policy on environmental protection and , especially , its efforts to incorporate the environmental dimension into all policies , i.e. mainstreaming .
As we all know , the bombings destroyed bridges , oil refineries and chemical factories , which damaged the ecology of all the areas along the Danube .
I would like to hear your views on the matter , Commissioner : do you intend to take action for the economic , ecological and cultural restoration of the areas which were damaged ?
She also reached agreement with the competent ministers of these countries on setting up a task force to handle these issues .
The key issues to be addressed by this international task force have already been established .
As far as the financial aspect is concerned , the Commission is in the process of looking into which funds could be made available for an emergency aid package .
Commissioner , I am convinced that the Committee on Budgets will be delighted to read this information as soon as they are provided with it .
Commissioner , thank you for your answer .
And not just these reactors , but also the reactors in Slovakia and Lithuania .
Of course , I appreciate that there are certain difficulties involved in closing them down immediately , but is that the earliest possible date ?
Mr Trakatellis , opinion is extremely divided as to how unsafe the reactors 3 and 4 actually are .
Now it is up to me who I believe .
I believe the reports that were compiled at the outset , and I still maintain that we must abide by the principle of risk avoidance in this case .
On the other hand , I must ask you to bear in mind that the decision on whether to go for the nuclear option in energy production is the sovereign right of each and every State .
The Commission is no more able than Parliament or the Council to forbid any country in the world from using nuclear energy , or to force them to shut down reactors without delay .
It must be left to the country concerned to determine how to implement the objectives set as quickly as possible .
All I can say is that this is what proved to be attainable during negotiations , which I headed myself part of the time .
If we had tried to achieve more , then we would have failed to reach agreement and ended up with no shutdown dates whatsoever .
As a matter of fact , I believe we achieved a particularly positive outcome in Bulgaria , in view of the extremely difficult situation there .
I would like to point something else out to you , somewhat circuitously , but you will soon see why .
As far as the shutdown dates for blocks 3and 4 are concerned , it says in the text that this will be decided on in 2002 .
So that is quite some way off the shutdown date we had mind .
As the Commission understands it , this shutdown will take place by latest - and I repeat , latest - 2006 , which is also stated in the text .
The fact that the Bulgarian government signed this text without questioning this , has a certain political significance .
That is all I can say on the matter , but I think you know what I am driving at .
Questions to Mr Lamy
Question No 44 by ( H-0206 / 00 ) :
As LLDCs account for less than 0.5 % of world trade , will he reconsider his reservations in this respect ?
What timetable does he propose for the implementation of this measure ?
The initiative was drawn up immediately after the Singapore Conference , when the Council invited the Commission to make proposals in favour of the least developed countries , both for immediate action and additional medium-term action .
In its conclusions dating from June 1997 , the Council made reference to the expression : ' essentially all the products of LLDCs ' .
The difference between all and essentially all products affects , as we well know , a number of specific agricultural products .
This is the mandate which the Commission was given and therefore , naturally , we must respect it .
My own services are currently preparing proposals which will be presented to the Council when they are completely ready .
I am thinking particularly of the markets of the developed countries : the United States , Japan , Australia , and New Zealand .
I am also thinking , possibly , of a number of emerging countries , already industrialised .
At the moment I am making great efforts to move forward this initiative which we have included in the rescue package which we are working on in Geneva .
That is the state of play at the present time .
It is therefore necessary to look at what is termed ' capacity building ' , i.e. technical assistance measures to be implemented in order to ensure that this access is tangible and not just theoretical .
This is the response I wished to give to this question which looks to the future .
I am grateful to Commissioner Lamy for his answer , as far as it went .
But my main concern in asking the question - and I do not feel this has been fully dealt with - is over this matter of exactly what " essential products " means .
What more specific comments can he make about which sectors and which products will be concerned , and for how long ?
That is the sort of message we want to hear .
We do not want to wait for five years ; let others follow our example " .
There are two parts to my answer to this question .
Firstly , I think I gave a clear answer to your question when I said that the difference between ' all ' and ' essentially all ' affected only a really very limited number of agricultural products .
I am thinking particularly of sugar which can effectively constitute an additional resource for several of these countries .
You know that the Community , and in this case the Commission , has considered the idea of a complete review of conditions in the sugar industry .
These are matters to which we shall no doubt return .
But that is something that only we need concern ourselves with .
Question No 45 by ( H-0208 / 00 ) :
Will the Commission agree to submit the agreement on China 's WTO accession to this Parliament 's assent even if the IGC has not yet been concluded ?
Mr Clegg , the Commission acknowledges that the agreement on China ' s accession to the WTO is an extremely important decision .
It is , moreover , exactly the type of agreement which would be submitted to Parliament ' s assent if the Commission ' s proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference were accepted by the Member States .
This would mean that Parliament should have the opportunity , pursuant to Article 300 , to declare its opinion on this agreement .
Obviously , in the normal course of things , it is up to the Council to consult the European Parliament .
This is the legal and institutional answer to your question , Mr Clegg .
With regard to more practical aspects , let me restate my determination to try to find some way , together with the European Parliament , to have Parliament play an active part in these negotiations .
I am therefore perfectly willing , as always , to discuss this matter in somewhat greater depth with the relevant parliamentary committee .
Thank you very much for that reply .
Let me reiterate my appreciation that the Commission and Parliament are , for the first time , speaking with one voice on changes to Parliament 's role in important trade agreements .
I would urge you to do so .
I would ask you what you think we could do together to promote this type of action .
Like you , Mr Clegg , I believe that China ' s accession to the WTO , whenever it takes place , is a matter of crucial importance .
Having said that , I feel that the comparison you make with the Uruguay Round is not totally justified .
I suppose , then , that the Council will be reluctant to require assent because the Council is not in the habit of going much further than is required by the Treaties in terms of consultation with Parliament .
Personally , I am perfectly willing to take part in this . I know , when the time comes , that questions of a rather more political nature will be asked .
That is perfectly normal , I feel , and I look forward to it .
My question , however , concerns concrete matters and the substance of this agreement .
This is a good question .
I remember using this expression , contrasting 80 % and 20 % .
That still leaves 20 % , however , and for a very simple reason .
In bilateral negotiations , each party tries to focus on the areas where he is least competitive , since it is understood that the rest will be left to the others .
That is the first reason .
There is another , more technical reason , involving some subtle points .
Although the designations are fairly similar , there may be very different tariff items .
Let me take the example of spirits . Bourbon and gin are not handled in the same way as whisky and cognac .
Even though all spirits are ostensibly the same , there are cases where tariff items are not the same .
These are more technical considerations , but they show that all these aspects must be looked into and negotiated in detail .
It is not quite over yet .
I mentioned that I would be going to Beijing during the last week in March in order to attempt to resolve what I feel are real difficulties in these negotiations .
These concern the political section with regard to which the Chinese authorities have expressed a number of reservations .
My mandate at present is to attempt to overcome these reservations , and I shall make every effort to do so .
Thank you very much , Mr Lamy .
The time allotted to Mr Lamy has fully elapsed .
Question No 46 will therefore be replied to in writing .
Questions to Mr Fischler
Since the author is not present , Question No 47 lapses .
Question No 48 by ( H-0173 / 00 ) :
Subject : Cost to agriculture of EU enlargement On the basis of the most recent studies and estimates , what cost will the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union place on agriculture and what will be the impact thereof ?
Although I have signed this question , as an elected representative , I must say that I am not really its author .
The Commissioner has not been explicit .
However , his services , the Commission , and some of us MEPs , all know that there are studies and estimates covering this issue .
The Commissioner is , at times , the master of side-stepping the question , with all the skill of a bullfighter , and failing to provide an answer .
However , the Commission , if it wants the countryside to support its positions , must clear the fog , and be explicit .
Mr President , Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I believe it should not come as news to you that farmers ' revenue does not just consist of subsidies , rather they must earn most of it on the market .
Therefore the comparison you have just drawn is inappropriate to my mind .
Secondly , these are two completely different questions .
In your question , which I answered , you asked what enlargement will cost .
The question as to whether the Common Agricultural Policy will be amended in the course of enlargement , is an entirely different matter .
All I can tell you today is that the CAP that was adopted in Berlin for the next seven years , still holds good .
In addition , a financial perspective was adopted in Berlin , i.e. we decided how much money we could spend .
You raised the idea of studies : the first studies were made several years back , and we sent these to Parliament .
We are in the process of carrying out new studies and as soon as we have the results , we will be more than happy to make them available to you .
Question No 50 by ( H-0190 / 00 ) :
It also analysed the fact that agreements with northern countries are under-utilised , despite the interest shown by other Member States in making use of these fishing opportunities .
Can the Commission say what studies it has carried out on the possibility of transferring quotas and what the outcome was ?
What decisions have been taken to balance the financial cost of agreements with the North and South ?
What is the Commission 's assessment of the above-mentioned imbalances between these two types of agreement ?
I actually referred to this at the beginning of my answer .
You mentioned the Council .
That is why we must overcome this problem .
But I do not believe that we can solve the problem by paying fees for fishing quotas under a new agreement with Greenland .
That is no way to solve the problem .
We must draw a distinction .
" Yes " to sharing out non-utilised quotas and a mechanism for doing so , but we should not start introducing licence fees where we do not have to pay for the quotas .
There is little point in doing that in our view .
Question No 51 by ( H-0195 / 00 ) :
Subject : Compatibility of special export aid with Community law Following the devastation caused by the storm which struck western Europe in December 1999 , the forestry sector is in a particularly serious plight .
Under the Community 's competition rules ( and , in particular , the Community preference requirement ) , such aid is rightly prohibited except when it is intended to remedy a situation which may be regarded as exceptional .
Hence , Article 92 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the EC Treaty states that ' aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences ' shall be compatible with the common market .
Is the export aid which has been made available by the French Government compatible with Article 92 ?
If so , could such aid be extended to cover timber exports to third countries ?
If so , what are the criteria used by the Commission in order to determine the amount of timber eligible for such aid ? For how long will the aid be available and what is the cost involved ?
The notification from the French Government includes a measure intended to facilitate the transportation of wood from the affected regions .
However , the notifications make no reference whatsoever to where the wood is destined for , in particular , they do not indicate whether it is to be exported to other Member States or to third countries .
Understandably , therefore , the Commission has asked the French Government for additional information .
I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify his answer .
Obviously such aid is already officially provided for in the countries of the Community .
My question clearly concerned exports outside the common market , outside the Union .
We can only apply existing Community law in such cases .
Provision is made , under Article 87 of this Community law , for damage - and I repeat , damage - which is the direct consequence of a disaster , to be made good .
In other words , firstly there has to be evidence of damage , and secondly , a direct link has to be established .
This would be a clear distortion of the market .
Question No 52 by ( H-0202 / 00 ) :
Subject : Preventive distillation - increasing the quotas The Commission has opened preventive distillation at 10 million hectolitres for the 1999 / 2000 wine year .
The notification periods have been extended .
According to available information , the quotas in some Member States have already been exceeded .
Does the Commission feel able to increase the preventive distillation volume from 10 to 15 million hectolitres and to comply with special requests from certain Member States ( e.g. Germany ) for a higher volume ?
Yes , Mr President , the Commission received the communications from the Member States with the applications for preventive distillation , on 24 February .
On the same day , a proposal was submitted to the administrative committee for wine marketing to the effect that the preventive distillation volume should be increased from 10 to 12 million hectolitres .
In fact this proposal met with the approval of a majority of the management committee .
That being the case , it will be possible to fulfil all the contracts concluded in the Member States .
The only exception in this respect is Spain , where , in view of the high number of applications , the take-up rate , if I can put it this way , was 98 % rather than 100 % .
This meant that Germany ' s original allocation of 148 000 hectolitres could be increased to 468 000 hectolitres .
That is what the contracts concluded in Germany amounted to in total .
The amended regulation on preventive distillation will be published in the Official Journal in the near future and will be made retrospective to 24 February .
I take the view - particularly in the light of the fact that we want to achieve a significant reduction in obligatory distillation - that we should not create the impression that we are now back-pedalling .
Thank you very much , Mr Fischler .
Questions Nos 53 to 60 will be replied to in writing .
Questions to Mrs de Palacio
Question No 61 by ( H-0156 / 00 ) :
The Commission has also confirmed that if the two countries in question agree , it will support the inclusion of the line in the trans-European rail network when the guidelines for that network are next revised .
What immediate action does the Commission intend to take in order to expedite such an agreement ?
In fact , these two extremes of the Pyrenees are suffering from saturation since they are the only real land links of any capacity between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the European continent .
Furthermore , as you know very well , Spain and France have set up a monitoring centre for traffic in the Pyrenees in order to seek the most suitable solution to the problem facing them .
In any event , the final decision in this respect is the responsibility of the Member States .
With regard to the Trans-European Networks we cannot include anything which is not supported by the Member States .
We are right , therefore , to ask questions about the future .
Personally , I am afraid that provision will be made for a little tourist train just to , perhaps , keep the ecologists happy , and that will be all .
However , as you well know , we clearly have problems with one of the countries involved with regard to the railway between Oloron and Canfranc .
There is no doubt that crossing the great mountain ranges of the European Union is a problem .
Furthermore , we intend to produce a communication on this subject - on the Pyrenees and the Alps - before the end of the year , proposing concrete solutions .
However , the concrete solutions must clearly be accepted by the Member States .
Having said all this , and as I have made very clear in some of my appearances , I believe that we must make an enormous effort to develop goods transport by rail .
Madam Vice-President of the Commission , I would like to know firstly whether it is true that one country is causing difficulties , secondly , which country this is and thirdly , what type of difficulty it is causing .
I would also like to know , since you have mentioned it , when the Commission communication on the report on the Alps and the Pyrenees will be made available ?
Since you have asked , the state which has opposed it until now is France .
It is clearly the countries of the Iberian peninsular which have the greatest interest here .
This does not only affect Spain , as the bordering country , but it also affects road traffic to Portugal , given that the Pyrenees pose such an obstacle .
Safety aspects are also important , given the use of extensive tunnels .
Question No 62 by ( H-0163 / 00 ) :
Subject : Blood / alcohol limits for drivers Since 1988 , the Commission has been advocating Community legislation concerning maximum blood alcohol limits for drivers .
In 1997 , the Commission stated that it was necessary , to reduce the number of road casualties and increase road safety .
At present , the limits vary widely within Europe , from 0.8 in some countries down to 0.2 in Sweden .
Sweden ' s experience has been very encouraging ; a low limit has increased road safety .
The EU is at present adopting legislation to promote mobility and road safety .
Why is the Commission reluctant to submit a proposal concerning maximum blood / alcohol limits for drivers , even though this would reduce the number of road deaths ?
As everyone knows , the excessive consumption of alcohol is the cause of many of our road accidents .
The European Union has supported , and the Commission considers important , a limitation on general levels of alcohol in the blood , specifically to guarantee that appropriate limits are not exceeded .
I must point out however that , although the Commission intends to express this type of guideline , it will do so by means of a recommendation .
Given the principle of subsidiarity , we do not consider it appropriate for us to propose a directive setting this limit on alcohol levels , but rather we should produce a recommendation to the Member States on this issue .
Alcohol constitutes the second greatest danger to health in the EU according to a report on health produced by a high-level working party .
Alcohol is also the greatest contributory cause of accidents on European roads and a very important contributory cause of the most serious accidents .
I find it extremely commendable that the Commission too considers that blood alcohol levels must be kept low among drivers , for safety and alcohol do not go together .
We know from the experience of countries which have low upper limits that this is a way of reducing the number of deaths and serious accidents .
I should also like to put a following question to the Commissioner .
Why should it be impossible to issue a directive covering this area when the majority of countries now have an upper limit of 0.5 per mille and only a few have a limit in excess of 0.5 per mille ?
As you have pointed out very well , the number of deaths on European roads caused by excessive alcohol consumption has risen to 10 000 .
Most countries apply a level of 0.5 mg .
The 0.8 mg limit is only in force in Ireland , Luxembourg , Italy and the United Kingdom , and only Sweden has a limit below 0.5 mg .
We are going to present a communication on road safety , which you in this Parliament will receive shortly , and recommend a maximum limit of 0.5 mg .
We consider that legislation should be reserved for cases where it is absolutely necessary to legislate .
Since there are very few states with a limit greater than 0.5 mg , we consider that his recommendation will be sufficient to persuade the relevant states to harmonise their own laws .
We believe that subsidiarity and the recommendation will be sufficient for the alcohol level in the various states to be set at 0.5 mg or less than 0.5 mg .
As we are talking about blood-alcohol levels I wonder if the Commissioner , in her recommendation is also going to be looking at the broader issue of drugs ?
This is an important issue that is often left out when we are talking about driving .
Will this ever be put into the recommendation ?
The problem is obviously that drugs produce states which clearly limit drivers ' response capacities .
Lastly , I must add that , in the case of drugs , control is more difficult , since the control systems are not so automatic nor so immediate as they are in the case of alcohol levels .
Question No 63 by ( H-0164 / 00 ) :
Subject : Verona-Munich railway link The project for a new Verona-Munich through railway line has been under discussion for years .
Traffic on the Verona-Munich route is increasing , yet only one third of the capacity of the existing railway line is being used .
The way to reduce the air and noise pollution caused by long-distance lorries would be to switch all heavy through traffic from road to rail .
To achieve this , motorway tolls for goods vehicles must be increased and a fast and efficient railway line must be provided .
If a new line is built , care must be taken to select the option that has the least damaging impact on the environment .
As the infrastructure is supposed to last for hundreds of years , it is essential to find the best solution .
It appears that the Commission favours the Brenner base tunnel project .
Why does the Commission not intend to reconsider the alternative ATT3 project put forward by the engineers Trojer and Kauer ?
Has the Commission studied the potential environmental impact of the various projects for a Verona-Munich rail link ?
Can the Commission finance a further study of the question of the transport of goods via the Brenner ?
In principle , it largely follows the route of the current conventional line .
The proposal of the ATT 3 project , which is well known to the Commission , deviates from the route established in the guidelines of the Trans-European Network .
I must say that the preparatory and construction measures have always been based on the agreed lines , and that to deviate from that initial approach would cause a significant delay in the development of the project itself .
After all , it would not be too difficult to transfer all the through heavy goods traffic to rail and bring it through the mountain , thereby solving the problem once and for all .
All we need is a ban on transiting heavy goods traffic .
This would relieve pressure on the Brenner motorway , which is under great strain and also causing a few problems of a socio-political nature , and would also free it up for private vehicles and local heavy goods traffic .
Amongst other things , in order to ban heavy transport , the first thing we need is an alternative route for heavy transport .
The truth is that there is currently no such alternative .
Therefore , the first thing we have to do is suitably develop the corresponding routes .
Of course , all of this is linked to our society and its development .
It is completely beyond me as to why anyone should ask the Commission to make sure that something is as harmful to the environment as it possibly could be .
This is all about people living in a sensitive area who must be protected .
The fact that this request came from the Greens makes it all the more baffling , and it should be thrown out for this reason .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions Nos 64 to 114 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes Questions to the Commission .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
Eco-label
Mr President , as you just said , this is the second reading for the directive on the awarding of the eco-label .
The European eco-label is , it has to be said , a product of the internal market .
Its function , partly in response to the increasing flow of products across borders , is to label products and services which have a high level of environmental compatibility .
And this is of major importance when it comes to the daily shopping trip .
I am of the opinion that the meaningfulness of a European label which is tailored to the European internal market is beyond dispute .
However , it is often a long road from the conception of a good idea to its practical implementation .
This is precisely the case with the eco-label whose main claim to fame at present is , unfortunately , its virtual anonymity in most States .
I think that only a very small minority of citizens have ever actually seen it and for this reason my report has paid greatest attention to the wholly inadequate preparations for the label .
What are the weaknesses in the current eco-label regulation which have given rise to today ' s unsatisfactory situation ?
I think that a key problem lies in the cost structure of the label .
The test procedures which companies and their products must go through in order to obtain the label are long and costly .
We are therefore advocating that the stipulation of testing requirements should look to keep test costs to an absolute minimum , although this must obviously not be misinterpreted as a qualitative watering down of testing requirements .
As well as the cost of test procedures , the on-going fees which must be paid to the European eco-label system are also highly significant .
Here , too , we envisage a reduction in costs for SMEs , firms in developing countries and enterprises involved in other aspects of European or international environmental legislation .
In this regard , I should cite , for example , EMAS and ISO 14001 .
In addition to a reduction in costs for certain enterprises , the report also envisages a maximum fee .
In this we are following the example of almost all the national labelling systems , which also have this ceiling .
The purpose of this approach is to make the labelling system equally attractive to large consumer goods manufacturers and service providers .
We must also clearly understand that without a certain amount of financial impetus for the European label we will not make any headway .
In my opinion , we should take on the responsibility for this financing .
Another important point in this second reading is the regulation of the relationship between the national eco-label and the European equivalent .
At first reading we were still advocating the gradual abolition of national labels in favour of the European eco-label ; it is not without good reason that we have abandoned this position .
In some States national labels are well established and enjoy public recognition .
This is the case , for example , as regards the Nordic Swan in Scandinavia and the Blue Angel in Germany .
In my estimation it would be nonsensical and contrary to the spirit of subsidiarity to abolish these proven labels in favour of an as yet unestablished European label .
Our approach should be different .
The eco-label regulation treads the fine line between economic and ecological interests , one group wanting above all to enforce stringent environmental requirements , the other with an eye on the marketing aspect of the label .
Both groups , however , have one thing in common : they want the eco-label to succeed .
Mr President , Commissioner , a speaker in this House yesterday expressed the view that economic globalisation is not an incontrovertible necessity but the evil outworking of a few multinationals .
And it goes without saying that this also applies to the awarding of an environmental label in the European Union .
Take the failed WTO negotiations in Seattle , which have opened our eyes as to the difficulty Europe faces in making itself heard by third countries when it comes to its progressive social and environmental standards .
Economic globalisation has already made it possible for developing countries to share in the prosperity of rich countries and will continue to do so in the future .
However , one thing must be made clear from the outset , and the common position before us does just that : the same rules must apply for all states .
If the production plants in a country are required to meet the criteria for the environmental label , then this applies to all the production plants where the product in question is manufactured .
If we can achieve this , then we will have globalised an important environmental principle .
Mr President , we have not yet given up on the goal of a common European label , at least that is my interpretation of the common position .
The eco-label may have suffered thus far from a lack of acceptance , but a working plan which allows for coordination with the national labels can only increase acceptance .
Our proposal in committee to automatically award the eco-label to products and services which already carry national labels and which satisfy the requirements of the European label did not , unfortunately , achieve a majority .
It would have afforded the opportunity to disseminate the European label even more quickly and effectively .
An important issue is the involvement of non-governmental organisations and associations .
It is essential that expert opinion and protection of consumer interests have some influence on the awarding process .
This can only benefit the status and merit of what the label stands for in terms of ecology and the consumer .
The aim of our amendments is to increase the participation of associations .
There is much to be said on the question of fees .
We need to introduce a system which covers the costs and it is therefore not right at this stage to fix maximum fees , which would seem premature until such time as we know the actual costs involved .
In this regard I would disagree with Mr Schnellhardt because it seems to me that even though the well-known national labels do give rise to costs , suppliers are still happy to acquire them .
It is right , however , that there should be a cost reduction for SMEs and for products from developing countries .
Overall , we must succeed in establishing the European label in Member States which do not have their own label .
If the common label has a function at present , it is that of filling the environmental label gaps in Europe .
The path which we are taking is the correct one , but a recognised common European label is not yet in sight and a major effort is required in this area .
We know from the Nordic Swan and the German Blue Angel that the eco-labelling of products is an extremely significant and powerful tool for getting consumers to change their purchasing behaviour and to shop in an environmentally friendly way .
I think that the Council ' s position is fairly commendable , and I am also satisfied with the amendments from the committee and from Mr Schnellhardt .
I consider , however , that the proposal needs to be reinforced in certain ways , above all when it comes to the role played by consumer and environmental groups and the co-existence of different eco-labelling systems .
Those who argue the case for having only the one eco-labelling system are making a big mistake , I believe .
I am totally convinced that , wherever there are well-functioning eco-labelling systems , it will be possible also to introduce the EU flower that much more easily and more quickly .
It is about getting the consumer to look for and to choose eco-labelled products .
Once purchasing behaviour has been altered , it is extremely simple .
The key to success lies , to a very large degree , in the credibility of the environmental and consumer groups and in the good opinion in which these are held .
If these groups are involved in the right way , eco-labelling will also develop very much more quickly .
If you would allow me to make a point of order ...
Mr President , the proposal we are now debating for a revised Community programme for awarding the eco-label has been significantly amended since the Commission ' s original proposal .
It has also been altered a great deal since its first reading by the European Parliament .
Happily , all these changes are , on the whole , improvements .
Those of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left believe that we have obtained a relatively good hearing for the views we already held at the first reading .
It is therefore especially important that the idea of prohibiting national eco-labels has been abandoned .
I also believe it is important to realise that there is nothing to prevent the existence of parallel eco-labels .
In Scandinavia , which perhaps has what is at present the most efficient eco-labelling system , there are now already a number of eco-labels complementing , and operating fairly well alongside , each other .
Secondly , we want the environmental movement to have a decisive influence over both the awarding of labels and the criteria for receiving them .
Our experience shows that the labels would , in that way , be given greater credibility .
Moreover , this system functions excellently where it has been introduced .
We are therefore especially pleased that the idea of a more commercial form of organisation has been abandoned .
I also think it is good that the idea of a graded eco-label has been done away with .
It is easier just to have the picture of a flower .
A graded system , like the one that existed originally , would probably cause more hassle than it would be worth in terms of additional information provided .
We are also pleased that the proposal is to cover the service sector , too .
Mr President , whilst recently at my sister-in-law 's house , I noticed that she had a container of " eco-friendly " washing-up liquid .
The moral of this story is , of course , that to compete in the mainstream market , eco-products must give a performance close to their alternatives .
Only then can these products move out of the niche market they already have and into the mainstream .
The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity .
The German Blue Angel and the Nordic Swan have led the way in eco-labelling .
To scrap these successful schemes now would be to throw away the baby with the bath water .
In the long term , I can see the merits of the single European eco-label , but this must not be imposed on those with existing schemes .
A single scheme has advantages for business : for example , only one registration fee and inspection , standardised packaging , and advantages for consumers who will not be confused by a plethora of labels .
Eco-labelling is moving on from forest products and detergents to computers and household appliances , but why stop there ?
Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register .
In addition , groups of similar small business could possibly cooperate and register together .
In the United Kingdom , we have a flourishing ethical financial services sector , offering savings and pensions which invest from a green perspective .
These should not only qualify for an eco-label , but be allowed to sell their products without hindrance throughout the EU in a single financial services market .
The proposal for a revised Community programme for awarding the eco-label is mainly aimed at making the programme more effective and more open and at improving the methods used .
It ought to make the programme more attractive to manufacturers , distributors and consumers .
In particular , the proposal accords greater responsibility to the bodies responsible for eco-labelling and to various interest groups when it comes to establishing ecological criteria .
The Commission considers that these objectives will be fulfilled thanks to cooperation with , and interest on the part of , the European Parliament and the Council .
I believe that the relationship between the Community ' s eco-labelling programme and the national eco-labelling programmes is better and more clearly defined in the current proposal .
The proposal also reinforces the interested parties ' role and participation .
This applies , in particular , to various interest groups and to the environmental bodies dedicated to eco-labelling .
Their participation is crucial if the present voluntary instrument is to be favoured and made more widely available in the correct way .
It is one of the few European instruments which will , in fact , be able to play a key role in supporting sustainable consumption .
With regard to the amendments tabled by the European Parliament , the Commission considers that these have helped improve the exposition of the regulation .
We are therefore able to accept these amendments .
We are therefore able to approve these amendments , too .
Amendment No 5 proposes four ways of making the fee structure more flexible and easier for those who apply to be accepted .
The Commission supports this overarching objective .
Amendment No 6 concerns fee reductions for small and medium-sized companies , as well as developing countries , and emphasises that these should be appreciable .
The Commission is able to support this amendment , too .
To summarise , the Commission is therefore able to approve all the amendments .
Mr President , I wanted earlier on , as I concluded my previous speech , to make a point of order to which I should like to alert the President and the Bureau .
Before the vote tomorrow , it needs to be made clear that certain amendments to the present report have not been translated .
They are only to be found in English .
This applies , for example , to Amendments 7 and 8 . These are only available in English , which is totally unacceptable .
If we are to be able to vote on this report , these amendments need at least to be read out before they are voted on .
That was the first point .
The second concerns , for example , the work programme for environmental strategy ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Thank you very much for pointing out the position regarding amendments .
The services are looking at this and I hope that they will be ready in time for tomorrow .
We cannot allow the debate to continue because we are running out of time .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your contribution .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Incineration of waste
On Amendments Nos 36 and 37 , which have been distributed , I am shown as the joint mover of the motion .
I discovered this yesterday evening and notified DG1 of the fact this morning .
DG1 acknowledged that a mistake had been made by the translation service .
I then asked for this to be corrected .
DG1 refused , saying that they did not have the time .
I should like to say that I think this is completely unacceptable .
They have had more than 12 hours in which to correct the amendments concerned .
I feel very put out that these have been made publicly available with wrong information about who the movers of the motion are .
It is a question , then , of Amendments Nos 36 and 37 , of which I am not the joint mover of the motion .
Thank you very much for pointing that out .
We will try and make sure it is corrected by tomorrow .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to thank the Members for their fruitful cooperation .
As a result of this , we have been able to table various amendments in a joint effort and reach agreement on a number of issues .
This is illustrated by the compromise we reached on the scope of the directive .
I would also like to thank the European Commission for providing the information and technical advice , which was extremely helpful .
In a civilised society , it is to be expected that waste should be processed in an effective and environmentally responsible manner .
In the European Community , this will increasingly be done by incinerating waste and recycling energy .
This process will obviously need to be closely monitored for emissions of dangerous substances .
Once we have reached a point where , in order to counter the adverse effects on the environment , dangerous and organic waste , in particular , is no longer dumped , incineration should then inevitably deliver environmental benefits .
By tightening up emission standards , a balance was struck at first reading between what is viable over a period of about five to seven years and what is necessary from an environmental point of view .
The emission values currently proposed by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection are a reasonable compromise .
It should , however , be noted that stricter requirements are already in place in a number of Member States .
It is one thing to prescribe sound environmental standards but quite another to comply with these .
Compliance requires adequate control which , in turn , requires proper monitoring .
Just imagine a situation in which we laid down excellent standards for emissions of dangerous substances such as dioxins but , on the other hand , left the way open for exemptions from all kinds of monitoring obligations .
We would then run the risk of not , on balance , making any progress , and the quality of air would not improve .
In addition , we also need to avoid a situation where it becomes clear there are long-term health risks for a reason which may not be immediately obvious , namely that the emission of harmful substances is not measured .
We cannot justify the occurrence of illnesses , such as cancer or blood diseases , which we have not prevented because there was no obligation to measure the emission of harmful substances by incineration plants .
Mr Florenz was among those who were right to point out that clear measuring regulations are vital .
I expect , therefore , that we will be joining forces in order to put a sound monitoring process in place .
As far as the scope of the directive is concerned , I am pleased to say that , thanks to good mutual cooperation , we have reached an acceptable wording .
Regarding the definition of coincineration plant , it is unfortunate that we were unable to reach agreement on this beforehand .
After many discussions involving various Members and the European Commission , a simple solution , which may well be acceptable , has been found in the form of Amendment No 43 .
If waste were used as a replacement raw material , such as in the recycling of glass , the relevant process would fall outside the scope of the directive .
If , on the other hand , only part of the waste were to be used as a replacement raw material , then this process would fall within the directive ' s scope .
Consequently , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has made a recommendation that energy recycling by means of combined electricity / heat production should also apply to the incineration of waste .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection has asked for ammonia levels to be measured .
It is wrong , however , that the standards for ammonia should not apply to all installations .
Accordingly , I have , for reasons of consistency , proposed an ammonia standard for cement kilns and for ordinary waste incinerators .
As far as the continuous sampling of dioxins is concerned , this appears to be quite feasible .
Belgium has started to use such a measuring technique in the wake of its dioxin crisis .
A cumulative sample is taken for a one-month period .
After this period , this sample is measured and the result gives a good indication of the levels of dioxin emitted during that month .
Needless to say , this is a more effective monitoring method than the random measurement method used twice a year .
According to experts , the costs are not higher since the measurement of cumulative samples is far cheaper .
As such , the cost of the equipment for continuous sampling is recouped within the space of a few years .
At first reading , considerable improvements were made to the Commission proposal thanks to a great deal of support .
It was at that stage that expectations were raised amongst the citizens .
I strongly urge MEPs to meet these expectations .
A consistent approach taken by the European Parliament will benefit our credibility amongst the citizens , especially those citizens living in the vicinity of plants which incinerate or co-incinerate waste .
This raises problems for us at several phases of the incineration process : the reception , processing and handling of the waste .
One might well ask what was the point of combining these two matters .
We can find the answer in Mr Blokland ' s report , which is violently opposed to the coincineration industry .
Paradoxically , however , by the same token , the rapporteur is in favour of mixing dangerous and non-dangerous waste .
What is the advantage of this for the environment ?
Our Group has no wish to favour either type of industry , since both are extremely useful to waste management in Europe .
The practices of each Member State must be taken into consideration , while maintaining the existing industrial balance and investigating how the environment can be better protected .
This is what the common position proposes .
Priority must be given to the emission limits for the most harmful substances , i.e. NOx , dioxins and furanes .
Moreover , the common position suggests an NOx limit value for the incineration of dangerous waste for the year 2007 .
Such a thing does not yet currently exist .
As regards dioxins and furanes , the limit values have now been made mandatory for all types of waste .
Until now , they applied only to non-dangerous waste .
It is therefore unfortunate that the Blokland report is putting unrealistic solutions forward when it is known that a good many directives on waste management are not yet applied or are not properly applied by Member States .
If one wishes to go too far , one becomes counter-productive .
It is completely unrealistic to wish to review the limit values of this directive every three years , if one considers the considerable investment that the industry would have to make .
What the industry needs is legal certainty and reasonable time periods .
Commissioner , waste management in Europe must undergo complete reform as a matter of urgency .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Blokland on this report .
We know that waste incineration is a very difficult and highly technical area , but I think that a creditable piece of work has been done in connection with this report .
I believe that we are , in this way , obtaining a good tool for preventing and limiting environmental damage in connection with waste incineration and for preventing and limiting the associated risks to human health .
Moreover , there are also some good resources which are being put to use .
I also think it is good that we should now be told very precisely which plants are covered by these rules and also which types of waste are thus exempt from them .
Finally , there is the absolutely crucial point about establishing emission limits in relation to air and water - whether we are talking about heavy metals or dust , ammonia , dioxin , sulphur dioxide or other hazardous substances .
I think that defensible levels have been identified in this connection , and a reasonable balance has been struck between incineration plants proper and the combined plants .
It is a balance that I hope will be maintained , including during the vote tomorrow here in the plenary sitting .
Again in contrast to Mrs Grossetête , I want , moreover , to say that the levels set here for emissions are realistic .
They are technologically feasible and they are , in actual fact , already being applied in a number of the Member States .
The existing plants which do not at present fulfil the requirements are also to be given a good few years in which to be adapted to the new requirements laid down here .
Mr President , Mr Blokland has carried out an enormous task .
This subject is incredibly involved .
Moreover , the lobbyists have been something else .
I should never have believed that there were so many of them concerned about waste in Europe .
You might have thought it was gold rather than waste they were talking about .
One never knows , but it perhaps bodes well for the future that a recycling industry is developing which possesses such competence and power in terms of financial resources and personnel .
Obviously , the EU must create a sustainable system for protecting air , land and water .
This is a common commitment and a common responsibility .
It clearly ought , too , to be regulated at European Union level .
But is this the right level at which to produce such very detailed technical descriptions as this Directive is attempting to produce ?
I should like us at some point , but not now , to debate the opportunities for creating framework legislation in this area .
With the predicted increase in incineration , it is vital that overall EU legislation on waste disposal and on air quality is consistent and comprehensive .
We must look at the whole hierarchy .
Incineration may increase as stricter controls are put on landfill , but it does not go hand in hand with recycling and environmentally friendly waste-disposal methods .
Building new incinerators is a costly and long-term venture which in turn has to have a long-term return for the investors , so it would be in their interests for waste to continue to be burned .
This Parliament must protect the health and quality of life of the people that we represent .
There is no safe threshold for dioxin emissions and more research is being done on the effects of micro-particles on human health and the environment .
So we have to ensure that there is frequent testing and monitoring , that regular and detailed information is made available to the public , and that real action is taken against breaches of the rules .
Measuring emissions twice a year may give an early indication of what is happening in an incineration plant and in the air that the local community is breathing .
Measuring once every two years would not do that .
So we must set the highest possible standards and not make exceptions which will weaken this very important legislation .
Mr President , you cannot dispose of waste by dumping it in the sea , shooting it into space , or by simply incinerating it .
It has a habit of reappearing , often in a more harmful form .
Incineration can be the cause of illnesses , air pollution , climatic change and a rise in the sea level .
A great deal of waste is incinerated these days , but not , in fact , by these expensive installations equipped with flue-gas cleaning devices .
These installations are not being brought up to date .
In fact , they are closed down if it appears that it is cheaper to co-incinerate waste in the cement industry and in electricity plants .
This is why it is important that incineration should cost the same across the board and meet the same high environmental requirements .
This issue , however , should form an exception .
Anyone , rich or poor , must be able to breathe , remain healthy and keep their feet dry .
Only a reckless short-term vision and the pursuit of quick profits can explain why attempts are still being made to weaken this directive .
Amendments of this kind reduce the directive to rules for those who would poison us and threaten the world with another flood .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left therefore supports the proposals made by Mr Blokland and hopes that destructive amendments will be withdrawn or rejected .
Mr President , waste management is now central to achieving the highest standards of environmental protection .
Regrettably , our consumer society is contributing to an increasing volume of domestic waste and there is also growing concern in relation to industrial waste .
Thankfully there is now an awareness among citizens of the importance of protecting the natural environment , and in my view the social and economic climate is conducive to achieving this objective .
We are all conscious of the need to reduce the volume of waste now disposed of in landfill sites and every effort must be made to find more environmentally friendly alternatives .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work .
The recommendation for second reading before us is an extremely important legislative resolution , not just for the environment but also for the economy of the European Union .
We should treat this seriously .
Not all amendments which are probably well intentioned from the environmental viewpoint are necessarily an improvement on the current situation .
I think this can be seen from some of the amendments which were put forward in committee with regard to coincineration and which now reappear as amendments in plenary .
We cannot in any way guarantee that in restricting coincineration we will actually achieve what we want environmentally .
Above all we want to save fossil fuels .
If we set up the hurdles wrong here , then we will not achieve the right environmental objective .
For this reason , our Group rejects the amendments which have been resubmitted by Mr Blokland , the Greens and others .
However , I think that there are still some amendments decided on in committee which we can support in good conscience in order to improve the common position .
I think it is realistic and , as the industry in question is saying the same , albeit with its hand in front of its mouth , we should be altogether more positive .
I think , therefore , that we are on the right track in accepting much of what has been decided in the committee , but certainly nothing which goes any further .
Mr President , unusually tonight I am not speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group , largely because I have some particularly strong views about this directive .
I do believe that Mr Blokland has produced the wrong report at the wrong time for the wrong reasons .
Given a task to do , Mr Blokland has produced a new and revised report that has certainly exceeded anything that we have done before .
We cannot say that it is all wrong .
Indeed there are many sensible proposals put forward in areas where the technology makes it possible to advance .
But quite frankly we cannot expect , having already given industry one set of rules to implement only a year or two ago , to hand them a completely new set of rules so quickly .
We have to expect that it will take time to implement this report .
Mr Blokland has also exceeded in many ways the brief he was given .
If one is being kind to this directive one could describe it as being good in parts , like the curate 's egg .
Unfortunately , this is going to give environment policy a bad name .
We should not be constantly re-regulating incinerators . We should be seeking ways to avoid incineration in the first place .
Parliament 's objective in waste management strategy is not to constantly tighten rules on existing incinerating plant , it is to change the role of waste management , to change the type of waste management that we do .
We would be much better concentrating our efforts in the next few years on recycling , re-use and other methods of reducing the waste heap .
If we do not , we will very soon find ourselves back with this problem again .
Mr President , I certainly agree with Mr Bowe 's final summary .
So I and many of my colleagues will be backing most of Mr Blokland 's amendments because we want the highest possible standards .
It would be a case of " throw it on the furnace " and putting it out of sight and out of mind which to my mind is a false approach .
We have to concentrate on reducing waste , recycling what is left and leaving incinerators as a last resort .
Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr Blokland for his report which strives to improve the Commission 's proposal , and the authors of the other amendments which do so as well .
But incineration has to be considered as a last resort and - as has been said already - waste reduction , re-use and recycling are the main things we should be striving for .
I just wonder about Mr Bowe 's statement about the need to reduce , recycle and re-use waste .
Will his position remain the same when he is debating the packaging directive ?
It will be interesting to see if he sticks to his principles there .
The only thing incineration does , as Mrs Evans has said , is to encourage the need for more waste .
It will not be economically viable if you do not have enough waste to keep the incinerators going .
We also must remember that waste does not disappear .
It is turned into dioxins and also toxic ash - what will you do with that ?
In Ireland , some operators are proposing using it in building materials .
What will be the long-term consequences of that ?
In Ireland , regardless of what my colleague Mr Hyland said , we have an appalling record on waste management .
We have one of the highest landfill records in Europe .
Now it seems the government are moving from landfill to incineration and it is being presented as the green option .
They say : " We are turning waste into energy - isn 't that wonderful ? " when in actual fact they are trying to hoodwink the public into believing that this is something that is ecologically sound .
The recent court case in Ireland which decided against the siting of an incinerator in an agricultural area was extremely important .
It is very important that we get our act right , that we look first and foremost at waste management .
For any government to propose that incineration should be introduced instead of landfill is completely misguided .
We have to look at the root causes of why the waste is there in the first place .
Mr President , the amendments by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy underline generally the high levels of environmental protection , and for that reason many of these amendments are acceptable .
There are differing infrastructures for the treatment and incineration of waste in different countries , however , and , as a result , the same provisions are not in fact the same for everyone .
In Finland and some other countries the sorting of waste in close proximity to where it originates is very advanced .
Thus , we do not incinerate mixed waste , as they do in certain countries .
The incineration of mixed waste is bad environmental policy .
Sorted waste can be incinerated effectively together with other fuels in a so-called coincineration process .
The amendments by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy unjustifiably lump together the incineration of mixed waste with parallel incineration .
That might have an adverse effect , as a result of its indirect economic impact , on levels of environmental protection in the countries that sort waste .
For that reason , Amendments Nos 14 , 17 , 18 and 27 should not be adopted .
Finally , I would like say that the cement industry lobby should not be put in a competitive position that is better than that enjoyed by the hazardous waste disposal plants .
Mr President , I find myself in agreement with Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Paulsen and - rather alarmingly for both of us - with Mr Bowe .
But I want to make a particular point in relation to an alarm which has been raised in the United Kingdom by the agricultural sector literally in the last few days .
A number of United Kingdom MEPs have been contacted by farming interests , who are very worried that the incineration directive will apply to all on-farm incinerators in the United Kingdom .
Typically , such incinerators deal with animal waste from the agriculture sector and with the disposal of empty pesticide containers at a rate of less than 50 kg an hour .
Both processes satisfy the criteria of best practicable environmental option and are accepted by environmental inspectors in the United Kingdom .
Have they received any representations from United Kingdom ministers ?
I have given the Commissioner notice of these questions .
Mr President , the treatment of waste and the whole policy on waste is becoming an ever more important part of EU environmental policy .
The Commission ' s proposal is not a total response to this idea , and is rather based on the notion that everything must and can be burnt .
I also hope there is support for the proposal that was very much endorsed by the Committee to facilitate the incineration of waste produced by the paper and cellulose industry at the production site .
This waste is an important energy source not only for the industrial plants themselves but also for the surrounding community .
Mr President , the directive on the incineration of waste is well intended but I think those responsible for preparing it have gone into too much detail .
I am mainly worried about the so-called coincineration of waste .
Sorted community waste and , for example , the fibrous pulp sludge that is produced in forest industry processes serve as good fuel supplements for many heating plants .
The draft , however , calls for ongoing , expensive , to some extent impossible , and environmentally unnecessary monitoring of plants that are engaged in harmless coincineration .
There are many amendments in the report that are problematic .
I think the matter should either go back to the Committee or the Council ' s common position , at least its main features , should be adhered to .
Mr President , honourable Members , efforts to set limits for pollutants produced by waste incineration and to introduce specific control procedures are indeed a positive step .
It is unacceptable for pollution to be transferred from the air into water and the ground .
The directive makes some headway in that direction .
Nevertheless , the problems inherent in waste incineration still remain , since it is the actual burning process which produces toxic substances , including dioxins .
This applies even more to domestic waste which contains negligible quantities of toxic substances before it is burned .
Treating dangerous and non-dangerous waste in the same way therefore exacerbates the problem .
What is more , the cost of installing and operating incineration units is far higher than the cost of mechanical recycling or sanitary landfill .
In a nutshell , the legislative proposal under discussion will not solve the problems inherent in incineration as a waste management method .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Blokland for this report ; he has had a very hard job to do .
Drafting environmental legislation for the whole of Europe is a demanding task , as circumstances in Member States differ enormously .
I myself come from a country where we have already opted for a policy that corresponds amazingly closely to the EU strategy on waste .
Only Finland has already embarked on perfectly feasible practices , as you have heard this evening .
This should not be happening .
Mrs Paulsen , was right : this is exactly where compliance with the principle of subsidiarity is needed .
If more stringent requirements regarding emissions are being illogically imposed on the use of waste as fuel than for other fuels , fuels classified as waste will cease to be used .
There are no alternative proposed uses for waste : it would be deposited in landfill sites .
That will add to the formation of methane , as a result of putrefaction of organic waste , and the greenhouse phenomenon .
This holds true especially for the incineration of harmless sludge produced by the paper and cellulose industry .
It is important that Parliament amends the proposal for the directive in this respect in accordance with the Committee ' s amendment .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted some proposals that , if realised , would make it harder to practise ecologically justified coincineration .
Another example is the call for the ongoing monitoring of the ammonia content of gas from chimneys .
That will add substantially to the costs of monitoring with no benefit to the environment , as the monitoring obligations have not just been imposed on those plants where ammonia emissions are generally produced .
Investments that do not bring a value added element with regard to the environment mean less investments that are of benefit to the environment .
Mr President , Mr Blokland , ladies and gentlemen , waste management is a complex task .
This is confirmed yet again by our discussions and the particularly powerful lobbying .
I therefore approve of the European Union ' s approach which is to adopt an overall strategy in relation to this major environmental and health issue .
Nonetheless , personally speaking , I have always been rather worried to see the incineration of dangerous and non-dangerous waste dealt with in the same legislation , and I expressed my opinion on this point at first reading .
The majority decided in favour of coincineration .
My opinion is that today we must fight to prevent the emission standards for dangerous waste being relaxed .
The volume of waste to be incinerated is going to be significantly increased .
The figure of 31 million tonnes in 1990 has been mentioned .
This year we are talking about close to 60 million tonnes , and waste incineration generates , as everyone has mentioned , the emission of particularly dangerous substances into the atmosphere and soil .
The debate has focused on coincineration .
Mr President , we all know that disposing of waste in an environmentally friendly manner and utilising its energy by means of the latest technology is a requirement of our time and wholly appropriate .
The directive on the incineration of waste contains important starting points for introducing compulsory high environmental standards throughout the European Union which have already been in place in some Member States for a number of years .
And this is important and necessary .
The aim of the directive is to establish emission levels which ensure harmless and environmentally friendly incineration of both dangerous and non-dangerous waste in incineration and coincineration plants without presenting any risk to human health .
People are sensitised today and have fears of a high level of air pollution and the illnesses which can result and so the policy must also create completely clear framework conditions to limit the risk .
Nevertheless , I must say that Mr Blokland is proposing some regulations and stringent conditions for the directive which go way beyond the objective .
The operating conditions for incineration plants , as proposed in Amendment No 11 , are neither appropriate to the objective nor practicable but , quite simply , superfluous .
Science and practice have shown for some time now that such a measure does not prevent high emissions of hydrogen chlorides and dioxins .
In practice , Amendment No 11 would also mean that many halogenated substances , for example PVC , which frequently occurs in mixed domestic waste , would be excluded from incineration in waste incineration plants .
A further point is to ensure that the directive does not give rise to any protected markets .
Industries which use coincineration plants in their production process have , for many years , successfully concerned themselves with achieving high air purity standards in incineration .
Many companies are also dependent on the use of waste to retain competitiveness and jobs .
Millions have already been spent on measures to reduce energy consumption .
In my opinion , we should not disregard these efforts ....
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I should like to make two brief points which may well be relevant should this go to conciliation , as I suspect it will .
The first is the impact of this directive on the existing specialist toxic waste incineration industry .
These incinerators have to adhere to higher standards than the coincineration plants .
We need the specialist toxic waste incinerators .
There are only three at the moment in the United Kingdom .
The second point I would make is to underline the point made by Dr Jackson .
I come from a region in the United Kingdom with the highest density of pigs .
If these incinerators are not used , people may well have to go back to burial .
Mr President , first and foremost , I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Blokland for the considerable commitment he has shown and for his well prepared recommendation for second reading .
Together with the Council ' s determination to arrive quickly at a common position , the report has helped with the efficient reading of the Commission ' s proposal .
The proposed directive on waste incineration goes to the heart of environmental legislation : the protection of public health .
The proposal will help reduce dioxin emissions from incineration by 90 per cent .
As from 2005 , when the directive begins to apply to existing plant , dioxin emissions from incinerators will be insignificant .
Together with the directive on waste deposition , the directive on waste incineration will put a stop to methods of treating waste which do not take account of future generations ' needs and interests .
Both directives constitute a firm basis for the sustainable treatment of the waste hierarchy , with improved preventative measures , better recycling and environmentally safe deposition of waste .
I should like to remind you that there already exists a directive on a waste hierarchy .
It is therefore obvious that , in this case , it is recycling that one should attempt , in the first place , to regulate .
Unfortunately , Mr Bowe , it has been 11 years since the technical requirements in these directives were last reviewed .
43 amendments have been tabled .
Of these , the Commission is able to approve eight in full , five in part and three in principle .
The following amendments are aimed at clarifying the Commission ' s proposal .
The Commission is not able to approve the first section of Amendment No 14 .
If the word " untreated " were to be deleted , it would no longer be possible to use mixed household waste in co-incinerators , something which would also apply to waste which had undergone extensive pre-treatment .
The second section of this amendment is , in principle , acceptable .
By introducing an explanation of the word " untreated " , the paragraph can be made less ambiguous .
The European Parliament ' s Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 7 , which are aimed at introducing provisions concerning the treatment of waste , cannot , for reasons of principle , be approved .
The Commission ' s proposal is aimed at introducing limits for emissions and at establishing operative conditions for all waste incinerated or co-incinerated , and this should not influence the legislation concerning the treatment of waste .
The Commission is not able to approve Amendments 5 and 15 which are designed to introduce links to standards of air and water quality .
Legislation of this kind already exists or is at present being prepared , for example the directives concerning air quality and coordinated measures to prevent and limit pollution , together with the proposed framework directive concerning water .
The amendments would involve the provisions in these acts being duplicated or becoming more ambiguous .
Amendments Nos 3 , 16 , 30 and 33-35 are not compatible with the directive ' s structure and cannot therefore be approved .
There has been a certain amount of confusion concerning Amendment No 13 where a number of language versions have been changed but not the English language version .
This amendment cannot , however , be adopted by the Commission .
Articles 12 and 15 of the proposal concern access to information and reporting .
They are now worded in such a way as to guarantee that all players have access to the information they require .
The Commission therefore considers that Amendments Nos 20 and 21 are unnecessary .
Amendments Nos 36-39 are designed to tighten up the requirements with regard to measurements .
The Commission is not able to accept these because they would place an additional burden upon those responsible and because no justification of their real value can be provided .
Finally , Annexes II , IV and V are , as you know , the heart of the Directive , establishing the limits for emissions in the cases of coincineration and incineration .
As I have already mentioned , the Commission accepts the proposed limit of 500 milligrams for nitric oxides in new cement kilns .
This is also justified from the point of view of cost-income analysis .
Any further amendment for the purpose of making the limits stricter or of removing from certain plants the right to be regarded as exceptions would threaten the delicate balance achieved in the common position .
The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments Nos 23 , 26 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 32 40 , 41 and 42 .
As I have noted previously , the Commission accepts parts of Amendment No 4 , which refers to Directive 74 / 442 and which indirectly makes it possible to exclude the incineration of infected animals on farms .
We consequently accept this principle .
The Commission is to investigate the possibility of extending the exception concerning radioactive waste also to include exceptions such as infected dead animals .
I understand that there is a debate going on in Great Britain , and perhaps in other places too , concerning the incineration of , for example , empty packages of insecticide etc .
It is not , of course , the intention that these should be incinerated .
That sounds dangerous .
Nor does it sound as if one should be burning them at home in one ' s backyard .
I do not want to exclude our needing to review how the exceptions are to be worded once we have obtained more information and know exactly what types of plant are concerned .
There was a certain amount of confusion because we at first believed that we were concerned here with dead animals and infected dead animals , of which we thought exceptions should be made .
My understanding from the interpretation was that the incineration of dead animals is not covered by this directive under the terms of Article 2 ( 2 ) .
I am looking at Article 2 ( 2 ) and I cannot see that exclusion set out there .
It talks about vegetable waste and vegetable waste does not cover dead animals .
However , I will get clarification from the Commissioner personally .
Infectious animal waste is not covered by the scope of this directive in its common position form because it is covered by Directive 90 / 667 .
The adoption of Amendment No 4 to Article 2 ( 2 ) might give the Commission the chance to revise the text so as to include a specific exclusion for infectious animal waste .
As things stand all other animal waste is covered by Article 2 ( 2 ) ( a ) ( v ) of the directive and Directive 90 / 667 .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Ozone in ambient air
This report sets national targets for ozone levels and proposes action plans for dealing with local problems of exceedance .
To save time I am going to assume that the respiratory and other health problems associated with ozone are understood , and that every Member of this House will want to reduce them .
The disputes between us will be about costs and time-scales , and perhaps also about the accuracy of the Commission 's methodology and the achievability of the targets it has set in this directive .
Let me deal directly with the Commission 's core proposal , the setting of a target for 2010 of 120 mg per cubic metre for ozone , not to be exceeded on more than 20 days per year .
Commission proposals for environmental improvements need to be both ambitious and realistic .
In particular , representatives of the Mediterranean countries point out problems resulting from the strong sunlight they enjoy .
I point out that the Commission 's methodology has taken full account of this but I look at their faces and still see a degree of scepticism .
I did wonder some months ago whether to table amendments , which would suggest a less ambitious outcome , but which would perhaps be more acceptable to Member States .
But the Commission 's 120 mg target is in line with World Health Organisation proposals , and who am I to suggest that they should be challenged ?
The number of days of exceedance could easily be adjusted , but that is something to negotiate only when necessary .
It is a good target and , if it is at all possible , then it should be retained .
The position I have taken in preparing this report is to say that those who want tougher targets than the Commission has proposed should have their views rejected .
But equally it would be wrong for us to water down the draft directive .
That is why I am sorry to see amendments tabled which reflect the Industry Committee 's position .
It seems to have been overlooked by many that these amendments , if carried , would leave the European Union in a much weaker position with regard to ozone targets than is enjoyed by the United States of America .
I ask Parliament to support my proposals , to give its backing to the Commissioner and to let her play her part in negotiating a common position which is both ambitious and politically realistic .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to put forward the proposal of the Industry Committee which was adopted by 40 votes to 4 and which deals with target values in particular .
For this reason , unlike the Environment Committee which has responsibility in this matter , we have not taken on board the proposals of the Commission wholesale , but have modified them .
This is a concern in particular for the warmer regions of Europe , namely coastal regions , which have to cope with a particularly high external ozone penetration .
I think we have put forward a reasonable compromise here .
In any case , we are prepared to compromise with the Commission , particularly as we assume that only this type of compromise will also find approval in the Council .
For this reason we are venturing to re-introduce this proposal on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party , even though it was marginally defeated in the Environment Committee .
We hope that you will consent to it .
Nevertheless , it seems to us to be inadvisable to accept the amendments which make 2010 the time limit , the only one in the short term , and set 2020 as the time limit for long term objectives .
Mr President , I should first of all like to thank Mr Chris Davies for this report .
Adoption of the Commission ' s proposal and of Mr Davies 's report will mean a considerable improvement in air quality for Europe 's citizens .
I think there are two crucial points here .
The first is that the WHO ' s guidelines should be adhered to .
I think that this would be an important step towards preventing serious illnesses and premature deaths , especially among particularly vulnerable sectors of the population , including children .
I think that setting dates is very important to our also in actual fact attaining the objectives .
The amendments would not only impair the Commission ' s proposal but also constitute a deterioration and retrograde step in relation to the situation of which we are now , in fact , aware in Europe .
As Mr Davies also mentioned , standards are , in actual fact , lower than those in the United States .
I do not know how one can call the proposals a happy medium or compromise , as Mr Langen did a moment ago .
I think they are completely incomprehensible and irresponsible .
They would involve serious health and environmental consequences for the people of Europe , together with a bill for Europe ' s health services to the tune of billions .
I would therefore very much recommend that we support the Commission ' s proposal , together with Mr Davies ' report .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Mr Davies on his excellent report .
I would also like to thank the European Commission for its sound green proposals .
Back in July 1995 , Strasbourg was labouring under ozone smog .
On the initiative of the Green Group , the European Parliament then adopted a resolution to halve the ozone standard stipulated in the 1992 directive .
The European Commission ' s proposal has made a lot of headway in this direction .
Ozone smog is still on the increase .
It is now even permeating the southern European skies during the winter months .
It has paralysed the traffic in northern Italy over the past couple of weeks and , during the summer months , countries such as Denmark and Sweden also suffer with ozone smog .
Ozone smog is now to be found everywhere in Europe .
Ozone is always an aggressive substance .
There are no safe ozone levels , despite what the World Health Organisation claims .
This is why the Green Group proposes allowing just fifteen exceedances of critical loads per annum .
This number is slightly lower than the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
My group can also support the twenty exceedances proposed by the Committee . However , it cannot back the proposal made by the Christian Democrats and UNICE Employers ' Union of forty such incidents per annum .
This is far too many and thirty years is a ridiculous time limit , given the fact that the problem is taking on such proportions .
In order to reach this strict ozone standard , the NOx emissions from traffic , in particular , and the emission of volatile organic substances will need to go down drastically .
This is the topic of Mrs Myller ' s report .
In the case of an ozone alert , we also need to be able to take short-term action .
The Dutch Government makes so many concessions to the transport lobby that it fails to realise this .
For my group , the car is no sacred cow .
Mr President , I too wish to thank Mr Davies for the report he has prepared .
It is an extremely important report , especially from a health perspective .
Seen from an environmental point of view , it is also intimately linked to the next subject , namely Mrs Myller ' s report .
I am convinced that these two reports together provide a sound basis for positive developments in Europe in the fields of health and the environment .
During the short time I have in which to speak , I should like to try to scotch some of the flourishing myths which exist with regard to the ozone issue .
This especially applies to the situation in southern Europe .
The climate in southern Europe is often used as a reason for , or explanation of , the high levels of ozone which are often to be found in the summertime .
It is true that climates with long periods of high pressure increase the presence of ozone .
The reasons have to be sought in traffic levels , in industrial processes and in energy production .
It is also these matters which we can influence by means of the Directives concerned .
It is therefore something of a pity that the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy should have such a detached attitude towards the present Directive and only see it in a perspective which favours industry .
Instead , we ought to see what happens when the limits set by the WHO are constantly exceeded and when people ( both residents and tourists ) are constantly exposed to a danger to their health .
We know that the risks are greatest for people who are in the open air a great deal , especially children .
We know that exceedance of ozone limits directly affects children ' s lung capacity .
The Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy ought to consider this when the present directive is voted upon tomorrow .
Mr President , I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy for their support of the Commission ' s proposal and draft report .
Within the European Union , we have achieved a certain amount of success when it comes to improving air quality .
Nonetheless , ozone still constitutes one of the most serious environmental problems .
On more than 60 days every summer in a number of locations in Central and Southern Europe , ozone levels exceed the target values set by the World Health Organisation .
The Fifth Environmental Action Programme established the long-term objective of ensuring that these limits were not in fact exceeded .
If we are to be able to solve this problem , we need to take measures with clearly defined subsidiary objectives .
The Commission ' s proposal therefore for the first time establishes clear limits upon ozone levels which , as far as possible , are to be attained by no later than the year 2010 .
The target value in terms of protecting people ' s health means that the WHO ' s guidelines must not be exceeded on more than 20 days per year .
Programmes for reducing emissions are necessary in those cases where the target values are not attained .
The directive on national emission ceilings , which is the next point on the agenda , will lead to improvements in ozone levels so that the target values in question might for the most part be attained .
The proposal is nonetheless a clear expression of the political will that exists to attain the long-term objectives in the directive , too .
Attaining the World Health Organisation ' s target values is only the first step .
In reviewing the Directive in the year 2004 , we must therefore analyse how and when we can achieve the long-term objective .
The Commission is able wholly to approve Amendments Nos 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 13 , 14 and 15 .
Amendment No 5 , section two , is also acceptable in view of the fact that the Member States have to prepare emission reduction programmes before they can implement them .
With regard to Amendment No 9 , the Commission is also able to approve some of the changes in their entirety and the majority of them in principle .
We approve those changes relating to short-term measures which are to be implemented in each zone in which the threshold value is exceeded .
We believe it is necessary for this information to be reported to the Commission . However , that issue is more at home in Article 10 .
The Commission is able to approve the principles behind Amendments 10 and 11 .
We are going to redraft subparagraph 1c in order to take account of the idea behind the last section of Amendment No 9 and Amendments Nos 10 and 11 .
Amendment No 12 can be approved in principle .
The Commission believes that progress by the Member States ought to be presented in a form which permits direct comparisons between countries , if that is possible in practice .
The principle in Amendment No 16 is also acceptable .
The Commission agrees that climate changes ought to be emphasised .
This ought , however , to be done in a broader perspective and not only in relation to changes in fuel consumption .
Amendment No 2 advocates coordination between Member States and Applicant States .
This can in principle be approved , but some rewording is required if misinterpretations are to be avoided .
We cannot , however , approve Amendment No 1 .
Even if the Commission agrees that it is important to involve the Applicant States , there is no reason for reiterating this in a directive aimed at the Member States .
Nor is Amendment No 8 acceptable when it comes to predictions of exceedances of information thresholds .
The use of prognosis models is specified as a prerequisite of thresholds for alerting the public , something which would make the way in which the public is informed or alerted less reliable .
This is an issue on which practical considerations and the possibility of practical implementation must be taken into account .
In addition , the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 28 .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow .
Atmospheric pollutants
Mr President , the European Union has ambitious goals for the environment , which were set forth , for example , in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme and the acidification strategy presented in 1997 .
These programmes stated as their aim the protection of people and nature from the adverse effects of air pollution , meaning that critical ceilings in respect of nature and people would not be exceeded .
The Commission ' s proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings is an important step in achieving the aims the Union set itself : to protect its citizens from the adverse effects of air pollutants .
The legacy of past decades is going to take some time to put right , however .
We are still not even aware of all the technical potential for ridding ourselves of sources of emissions entirely .
For this reason , it is reasonable to proceed in stages , as the Commission has proposed .
The first stage is the Interim Environmental Objectives to be achieved by 2010 , which means cutting health-threatening ozone loads by two-thirds by that year .
Owing to this , I have recommended in my report a long-term goal , in addition to the interim one , and a final target for 2020 .
In that way , we would finally be able to reach a point where critical levels and loads are not exceeded and everyone will be protected effectively from all known health effects of air pollution .
In this connection I would like to draw your attention to my amendment , in which , owing to a translation error , there is a wrong word in your copy of the document .
In place of ' reached ' it should say ' exceeded ' .
I hope that this will be sorted out before tomorrow ' s vote .
How , then , do we achieve a situation in which air pollution does not exceed tolerance levels for humans and for nature ?
Dealing with these problems and the emissions that cause them together has proved to be the most cost-effective way of tackling the causes of air pollution and bringing it under control .
The biggest disagreements in the implementation of the directive relate to the limit values , i.e. , the emission ceiling set for each country .
There is a clear difference between this proposal and the Commission ' s .
If we were to accept the ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol , we would never reach the targets that the Union has set itself regarding air pollution .
It has to be said , however , that there is very considerable exaggeration with regard to the costs involved .
Mr President , the industry committee , after much discussion and serious consideration , is overwhelmingly opposed to the Commission 's proposed ceilings , and this is across all groups and nationalities .
The UN ECE ceilings were agreed by all our Member States , by the applicant countries and globally , in a protocol signed at Gothenburg as recently as November 1999 .
Why did the Commission come up with these even stricter and substantially more expensive ceilings only one month later ?
I understand that the groups , the whole Parliament , are split on this issue , between supporters of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and supporters of the industry committee 's line .
The industry committee urges this House to vote in favour of the amendments which are tabled in my name and in the name of Mr Bowe .
These are the amendments passed by the industry committee .
The UN ceilings are quite ambitious enough for us to reach our internationally agreed targets in reasonable time .
The industry committee wishes to see these limits fully and properly implemented across the European Union and globally .
Support the Purvis amendments and the United Nations Gothenburg table of national emission ceilings .
Mr President , it has become universally acknowledged that environmental pollution , and certainly air pollution , are cross-border issues par excellence .
The present draft directive on national emission ceilings tackles the key culprits where atmospheric pollution is concerned .
It contains maximum emission levels for substances which are responsible for acidification , ozone forming in the troposphere and the eutrophication of soil .
As the topic is reasonably technical , I will only single out the salient points on behalf of myself and my group .
The directive ' s key goal is to reduce the emission levels of said substances to below the critical levels and , hence , pollution .
These goals must be met by 2010 , with an interim assessment of the national programmes in 2006 .
The most important - and you have heard so yourself just now - and most talked about component of the proposal is , of course , the table which specifies the permitted annual emission levels for each country .
The fact that , at UN level , 36 countries , including 15 EU Member States , recently agreed on less strict standards for the same substances played an important role in the discussion .
There are now Members who urge that this table , i.e. the European Commission ' s table , be replaced by the UN ' s so-called Gothenburg table , which permits a higher ceiling .
Mr President , I have to admit that this line of argument is rather weak .
Moreover , it is incorrect that the European ceilings were established after completion of the UN negotiations .
Mr President , I do have another problem , namely that concerning ammonia .
The Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats would like to see the present ceiling adjusted .
Looking at the nitrate directive , I notice that hardly any Member State meets the standard specified .
It seems to me completely unfeasible to go beyond the Gothenburg standard .
In addition , the effects of ammonia emissions are partly local and , as such , a lower threshold seems acceptable .
The reason for this is that I hope that , by then , the effects of the implementation and the pending European legislation on nitrate will be able to give us better indications .
I would like to conclude by making the following comment : legislation on ceilings is , in actual fact , the counterpart of legislation on large furnaces , for which I also happen to be rapporteur .
We completed the first reading even before last year ' s elections .
The Council of Ministers , however , is still putting a spanner in the works .
Could we be informed on the progress made ?
As a final remark , I would like to thank Mrs Myller , the rapporteur .
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Myller for her report and her ambitious treatment of the directive proposed by the Commission .
Instead , it has been with us for as long as industrialisation - for 100 years .
Research into the question has been going on for 30 years . None of us ought to be in any doubt about what the sources of acidification are , nor about what we should be doing regarding this issue .
Some accuse the Commission ' s proposal , and also the report , as being excessive and far too costly to implement and say that the calculations that have been made are utopian .
This is , however , wrong because we know that the Member States themselves have contributed to the report which serves as a basis for the whole directive .
If we had been a little quicker off the mark , the present directive would have been on the table - signed , sealed and delivered - long before the so-called Gothenburg Protocol .
The word " impossible " has been used about the directive . I should like to say , however , that what is impossible is the situation which we have at present .
The impossibility lies , therefore , not in the directive but in the current situation .
Mr President , my congratulations to Mrs Myller who I know has thought long and hard about this report .
It seems to me that the debate comes down to this : do we believe that the Gothenburg Protocol was the best Member States can realistically achieve ?
Some Member States seem to have gone into the negotiations with a few calculations on the back of an envelope and refused to compromise in any way to set themselves any realistic targets .
Others have not even used the same methodology , the same basis of calculation as others .
So the protocol in many ways is a nonsense .
It can give us no confidence whatsoever .
It is a messy political compromise and nothing more .
I do not know how much more the Commissioner can achieve but we should be seeking reductions in air pollution and we should be giving her our support in her efforts to negotiate them .
We should support this report and give her our backing .
Mr President , Mrs Myller has produced an excellent report , and our group too thinks we should go at lot further than the Gothenburg Protocol on this .
In all probability , drafting this directive was like a national auction , and the end result is very modest when we think what the real challenges are .
But , in any case , it is important that the European Parliament should now defend at least that policy which the Commission has chosen .
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance proposes that even stricter goals should be set for 2010 than the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has recommended .
We want to emphasise that an integrated strategy must be adopted to reduce emissions .
We have to remember that , in any case , we have the implementation of the Kyoto commitments ahead of us , which will mean insisting on more efficient use of energy and simply using less of it .
So , in our opinion , this directive must take into consideration that added benefit is to be had from an integrated strategy as regards implementing its objectives .
Mr President , in order to meet the objectives for air emission levels prescribed in the Fifth Environmental Action Programme , we need this directive on emission ceilings more than anything .
If we want to combat acidification , manure pollution and smog formation , we need to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide , nitrogen oxide , ammonia and volatile organic substances .
The Council ' s conclusions concerning the EU acidification strategy have raised expectations which now have to be given substance .
This could even be done in a cost-effective way , as is evident from the explanatory note to the Commission proposal .
We all know by now that six months ago , higher emission levels were agreed at Gothenburg within a UN context .
These values , however , are the result of a political compromise between states , and the results of the model used by the Commission have been overlooked .
This model is sound and the results are well founded .
Also in view of the fact that , with these emission ceilings , the objectives of the EU ' s Fifth Environmental Action Programme still cannot be met , a relaxation of the values is unjustified .
The first step towards achieving the emission ceilings is undoubtedly a dynamic implementation and enforcement of existing directives , such as the Auto-oil programme .
In addition , we need to lay down new legislation in this field as soon as possible .
In this connection , I would once more urge the Council to produce a common position on large furnaces as a matter of urgency .
Finally , additional policy , for example in the field of volatile solvents used in paints and varnishes , as well as in car spraying , will continue to be necessary .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly I too would like to thank the rapporteur .
Now to the issues : it is obvious that there are differing opinions in this House on whether the proposal of the European Commission is too ambitious .
Many are saying that it cannot be implemented using current technology or only at an exorbitant cost .
The Commission itself says that the proposal can be implemented cost effectively .
In my opinion this is not ambitious ; if anything , the opposite .
We in this House have always agreed that we must reduce the proportion of fossil fuels and that we must save energy .
If we do not achieve this , then this is a declaration of environmental bankruptcy .
If the perceptions of the European Commission as regards this basic assumption become reality , then there is no need for us to talk any further in this House about climate protection .
We must increase energy efficiency , improve energy saving and promote regenerative energies whilst , at the same time , recognising that nuclear energy produces neither CO2 nor SO2 nor NH3 , volatile organic compounds or NOx .
This cannot happen within the context of collective environmental responsibility .
All the same , I would like once again to stress the fact that the Commission proposal is not too ambitious , but if anything a little too unambitious .
I will support it tomorrow in the vote and I hope that the majority of the House will do the same .
Mr President , I certainly welcome this report and I gave it a lot of support in the Environment Committee .
I creates a proper framework in which we can work in the long term to reduce emissions .
The vast majority of the amendments I can support .
I want to come to the issue which Mr Davies has addressed , namely , where we should start from .
With what targets are we to start ?
It seems to me that the Commission figures are aspirational .
Yes , we could go there - we should be trying to go there , but I do not think we should be starting there .
We should be starting with the UN / ECE figures , with the Gothenburg protocol and revising them as is proposed by Mrs Myller in her report .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have , of course , nothing against the principle of the directive .
It is an important instrument for future environmental policy .
The Member States are given a clearer brief .
They know what they should be aiming for .
Upon examination of the table with the different ceilings for each Member State , however , I get the impression that there are double standards .
That is because a large country can use its better regions to offset its bad practices .
A small country is not in a position to do this .
I shall give you an example .
From your statistics and maps , it appears that in northern France , which is just as polluting and polluted as Belgium , matters can be processed at a lower level .
According to your calculations , the implementation of this directive costs each Belgian EUR 103 per annum , compared to EUR 15 for each person in France , including northern France .
That is eight times less . This is partly due to the fact that we are a small country and we are surrounded by polluters .
One per cent of the GDP per annum is too much of a strain for my country .
I would therefore ask you to give me your backing for Amendments Nos 16 and 17 , in which I request that the Belgian Government be given the chance to re-evaluate the situation based on the annual reports .
Mr President , the biggest environmental problem in my own country is the acidification of land , forests , lakes and watercourses .
Acidification leads to the death , or reduced growth , of forests and causes fish to die and fewer plants to grow .
Acidified water also releases heavy metals which constitute a health problem .
The countryside in the Nordic countries is particularly vulnerable to acidification because these countries are largely lacking in means to protect themselves against it .
Acidification occurs due to acid rain , caused by air polluting emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels .
In Sweden and Finland , we have taken extensive measures in order to reduce national levels of air pollution .
We are making major efforts to add lime to lakes and wetlands .
We are , for the most part , complying with the emission targets proposed in the now current directive .
However , more than 80 per cent of the acid rain over our country comes from air pollution not in our own countries but in other West European countries .
We are therefore appealing for your help .
Many North Europeans believe that it is only through environmental cooperation with other EU countries that our problems with acidification can be solved .
To the members of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy I want to say that the UN resolution in accordance with the Gothenburg Protocol is far from being adequate .
I am convinced that the EU can be better than the UN at solving the environmental problems in Europe .
The proposed EU directive against air pollution can , in fact , constitute an important step towards combating the acidification of the countryside , mainly in the northern area of the EU .
In addition , significant reductions in the percentages of unhealthy ground-level ozone , mainly in big cities in the southern part of the EU , can at the same time be attained .
We ought therefore to have a common interest in applauding the present EU draft directive .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a fair wind is blowing the way of the environment and the European Parliament welcomes this .
Indeed , by virtue of an unusually fortunate coincidence , directives on waste incineration , on limit values for national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants , and ozone in ambient air all feature on today ' s agenda .
Previously , atmospheric pollution used to be associated with roads and traffic .
Today , however , on a large scale , it refers to the whole world , and on a small scale , it even means the house we live in .
In short , it means our whole ecosystem , and action must be taken .
Setting emission limits for the four main pollutants is a sure way to help to reduce pollution , combat acidification and limit the harmful effects of these pollutants on human health and on plant life .
In its proposal for a directive , the European Commission proposes quantified national emission ceilings , which must be met by 2010 for the four pollutants I have just mentioned .
Furthermore , it estimates the costs for each Member State of complying with these limits .
I think that this is a good strategy .
Mrs Myller ' s excellent report makes a lucid evaluation of the European Commission ' s proposal and considers it to be balanced ; the report also seeks to strengthen the proposal in some areas .
In particular , the committee approved a compulsory review of the directive by 2004 , which will enable there to be a review of the limit values stipulated and measures adopted to ensure that these limit values are respected .
All of this seems quite reasonable .
Nevertheless , I must ask a question here .
Would this not be wise ?
The EU system for combating atmospheric pollution is thus being extended , strengthened and refined .
EU environmental policy is becoming more and more the environmental policy of each Member State , with obvious advantages for all Europe ' s citizens .
However , I also understand those views that advocate electing the ceilings proposed under the Gothenburg Protocol .
It is important that the environmental objectives are achieved as cost-effectively as possible throughout the whole Community .
Air quality in Europe has improved considerably in recent years .
Emission levels have decreased significantly , at least in the energy sector , in transport and in industry .
In recent years , there have been more and more EU acts in the area of the environment and new targets have been set for industry .
Before further obligations are imposed it is important to ensure that the action that has already been agreed is implemented in the Member States in every respect .
These two goals are not , in my opinion , mutually exclusive .
Finally , I believe there should be international agreements on ceilings for emissions for shipping and aircraft , and , at this stage , they should not fall within the scope of the directive .
Mr President , honourable Members of Parliament , we have made great strides in tackling acidification and also pollution in recent years .
I hope that this proposal will be another important step in this direction and that is why I especially want to thank the rapporteur Mrs Myller for her valuable work .
The Gothenburg Protocol is a step forward .
However , it is nowhere near enough .
The protocol goes only halfway towards the goal for acidification already agreed by Parliament and the Council .
A substantial number of people will die early if we do not adopt the measures proposed by the Commission .
The protocol is the result of a process in which there is too little pressure on the reluctant to do what they should .
We cannot let this deflect the Community from agreed goals .
The costs of the Commission 's proposal must be kept in perspective , even on the Commission 's highly pessimistic estimate which would not take full account of Kyoto or non-technical solutions .
They amount to only 0.08 % of Community GDP in the year 2010 .
Member States will have to do some of the things that will let them meet proposed emissions ceilings more cheaply if they are to live up to their Kyoto commitments .
Saying that the ceilings are too difficult is dangerously close to ignoring Kyoto .
Let me now turn to the amendments .
The Commission can accept fully Amendments Nos 3 , 8 , 9 , 13 , 19 and 21 .
The Commission can accept in part the principle underlying Amendments Nos 1 and 2 .
We will draft a recital which does not appear to restrict the Commission 's right of initiative , for inclusion in our amended proposal .
We will also include a reference in Article 9 of the directive in order to make the new recital operational .
It follows that the Commission does not accept Amendment No 27 .
The aim of the Commission 's proposal is to leave as much flexibility as possible to Member States , but we cannot rule out further Community action if this would help Member States to meet emission ceilings more cost-effectively .
The Commission can also accept in part Amendment No 11 which would make further changes to Article 9 .
We agree that review of the legislation should take account of aircraft emissions , further emission reductions in regions bordering on the Community , measures taken in applicant countries and transport factors .
The Commission cannot however agree to bring forward the dates for reports to Parliament and Council .
In 2003 the Commission will have almost no data from Member States on which to report and base any decisions .
The Commission will not know in 2011 whether or not ceilings were met in 2010 because of the time that must be allowed for Member States to compile inventories .
We accept in part the principles underlying Amendment No 12 .
We will therefore redraft Article 9 ( 3 ) to incorporate much of the material in the proposed amendment .
The Commission accepts the principles of Amendment No 23 . The reference to countries outside the UN / ECE process must be restricted to those who have supplied data and whose emissions are relevant to pollution in the Community .
The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 24 , 25 and 26 in principle , and will also take them into account when it redrafts Article 9 as part of its amended proposal .
The Commission has a great deal of sympathy with the concerns underlying Amendments Nos 16 and 17 .
Allowance should be made for the fact that smaller Member States have less room to spread the load .
However we are dealing here with transboundary pollution , so the Commission considers that adjustments to ceilings for individual Member States can only be made as part of a general review of ceilings .
We will therefore propose a new recital and changes to Article 9 , which will ensure that effects on smaller Member States are properly taken into account on review .
The Commission can accept that part of Amendment No 20 that would insert " an appropriate " into Recital 9 .
We do not accept the remainder of Amendment No 20 .
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15 , 28 , 29 and 32 .
They seek to replace emission ceilings that are designed to meet the agreed Community target for acidification , and to protect our citizens ' health , with the emission ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol .
Gothenburg ceilings fall far short of what is needed as has already been said .
The Commission considers that , if Member States take seriously the Kyoto commitments , the emission ceilings that it has proposed will not be difficult to implement .
We may well be able to go further by 2010 , but this is something that can only be decided when we know how Member States will meet their Kyoto targets .
We cannot therefore accept Amendment No 31 .
The Commission cannot accept Amendments No 4 and 14 : under the principle of subsidiarity it is for Member States , not the Commission , to determine penalties for breaches of national legislation .
Furthermore , Amendment No 14 seeks to restrict the Commission 's discretion under the Treaty to decide when to bring infringement proceedings .
Amendments Nos 5 , 18 and 30 are also unacceptable .
The Commission is committed to pursuing long-term objectives for protection of the environment and human health , but we simply do not have enough information today to predict when long-term objectives might be reached .
The Commission must reject Amendment No 6 .
Emissions from international maritime traffic and cruising aircraft cannot be wholly controlled by individual Member States , nor even by Community action , and cannot therefore be included in national emission ceilings .
Action where appropriate must be taken in the International Maritime Organisation or the International Civil Aviation Organisation .
Last week , the IMO agreed to a proposal from the Community to declare the North Sea a sulphur dioxide control area .
The Commission will examine whether further such proposals should be made to the IMO , and whether international action is also needed on aircraft emissions .
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7 .
It is based on a misleading comparison with the solvents directive , where processes may involve high temperatures .
Non-volatile organic compounds are automatically excluded from the definition of " volatile organic compound " in these proposals since they are not found in the air in ambient conditions and do not contribute to ozone formation .
The proposed definition is identical in the Gothenburg Protocol .
We must maintain technical consistency .
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10 .
It would remove an essential obligation for Member States regularly to update emission inventories .
Finally , Mr President , we do not accept Amendment No 22 .
The Commission 's proposed wording on the key issue of public information is in line with agreements on the first two air quality daughter directives .
Finally , I should like to answer Mrs Oomen-Ruijten because she asked about the proposals on large combustion plants .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Environmental legislation
Mr President , I would like , on behalf of the committee , to move at least one of the oral questions .
First of all , I sympathise with the Commissioner 's desire to get better implementation of European Union law .
That is something which the committee as a whole is keen to see .
I want to quote from an article in the United Kingdom Sunday Telegraph this last Sunday .
I would like to know if the Commission is making these threats and , if it is , whether it feels that it has an entitlement to do so .
That is a question which my German colleagues who are moving the other question want to follow up .
The Environment Committee is very interested in finding ways of incorporating environmental considerations into other policies .
The question is : is this a constitutionally viable way of doing that ?
What we are exploring here tonight in this crowded House is the question of linkage .
That is something which we find reflected in the views not only of some of the German Members here tonight but also in some of my British colleagues .
At its worst , we want to avoid the possibility that the aims of the structural funds and the European Union 's concern to protect its natural habitats may collide .
Such possibilities have arisen in the past , especially in relation to major infrastructure projects .
The fault lies with those Member States which have failed to observe the directive , and that includes my own .
If doubt hangs over their entitlement to structural funds , that is the fault of national governments .
That doubt has now fallen over the position of the United Kingdom and its entitlement to Structural Funds because the United Kingdom government has not fully implemented or complied with the provisions of the habitats directive .
It is in the power of the United Kingdom government , the German government and other national governments to remove that threat by complying with the habitats and birds directive .
Even if the European Commission uses its best efforts in the United Kingdom there is no guarantee that the scrooge-like United Kingdom Chancellor will find matching funding .
Mr President , the FFH directive is an issue which has concerned us for some time now and we are currently experiencing a few teething problems .
However , to begin let me say the following : the FFH directive is an important directive and creates a new climate in Europe for the protection of nature , the environment and birds .
I would not want to change or spare anything in achieving this .
I also find it encouraging that the Commission is consequently taking care that EU legislation is being implemented .
All the same , in the case of the FFH directive the question arises as to whether the legislation which we have adopted is actually implementable and I can see obvious weak points .
As I see it , the FFH directive is an instance where the legislation is not matched to the feasibilities of the regions .
Revision of the FFH directive , including the current difficulties in implementation , should not , I think be excluded .
Alongside this general criticism of the FFH directive , however , I also see a particular problem with the amalgamation of the EU environmental and structural policies .
To date , the Commission has only threatened sanctions in the case of the FFH directive .
Does it also intend to initiate sanction mechanisms in the other areas ?
In my opinion , this is a very problematic course of action .
The EU has a quite different means of enforcing sanctions , i.e. the European Court of Justice .
The possible cutting or withholding of money from the Structural Fund is a form of sanction whose effect on the regions concerned cannot just be disregarded .
What will happen with projects which are already under way and what will happen , above all , in those cases where a region does not receive any money from the Structural Fund ?
What sanctions will the Commission then impose for non-implementation of EU environment law ?
I would ask that we make this point absolutely clear here .
At the moment , I am more interested in protected areas for delegates , but that is another matter .
Our question to you , Commissioner , has another purpose .
I would have liked to hear your answer first , but you have chosen to speak at the end of the debate .
We are discussing something here of which most know the history .
The fauna-flora-habitats legislation should have been implemented by 1994 - it is now the year 2000 .
The European Union list of the relevant nature conservation sites should have been ready in 1998 - it is now the year 2000 .
The Member States should have notified the Commission of their sites by 1995 - it is now the year 2000 .
Many Member States , including my own , did not do as required .
Germany , for example , implemented the legislation in 1998 instead of 1994 - only four years late .
But what does it matter ? !
As a result , the European Union list is obviously not ready .
And how could it be ?
Many Member States and many regions have not announced their sites .
Now Mr Schnellhardt has even suggested that perhaps we made a mistake with the fauna-flora-habitats directive .
Perhaps , Mr Schnellhardt , you are right that it wasn ' t totally practical , it wasn ' t perfect , it wasn ' t quite right .
Unfortunately , however , it is not the procedure in the European Union that if you don ' t like a piece of legislation you don ' t bother observing it .
If that were the case , then there would also be areas and matters which you and I would not like .
But we do have this unfortunate system in the European Union - what you call legal certainty .
We do have this unfortunate system - it is what you call legislation , which has been adopted in this European Parliament with the consent of the Member States .
It must be observed !
It might perhaps be a bit too strict and too legalistic , but that ' s the way it is : we are living in a European Union with a legal system .
However , I do not want to pass sentence on Mr Schnellhardt , who comes from one of the new federal states who do not have things quite so good .
That is an internal German problem which we will resolve at another time and in another place in the House .
Today , Mr President , we are talking about the fact that Europe is losing its countryside and about the fact that Europe must observe legal certainty .
You must do it !
If you think the legislation is no good , let us revise it .
If you think it is sound , go to the European Court of Justice , and be quick about it !
Mr President , it is a pleasure to face the Commissioner for the fifth time today at this unearthly hour .
I congratulate her for her efforts in trying to make sure that the habitats directive and associated directives are properly implemented .
I wish her well .
I have heard that some in the Commission believe that they have managed to squeeze more out of Member States in the past six months than they had in the previous six years .
If that is the case then it is good news indeed .
But the Commissioner is riding between two horses : one seeks to protect endangered species , the other seeks to assist the poorest parts of Europe .
In fact , it is a position in which I too find myself to some extent .
Some simple questions : how long is the Commissioner prepared to perform this balancing act ?
Just how much must Member States do to meet her requirements ?
Is she really prepared to tell people such as those whom I represent in Merseyside and the North-West of England that they must lose Structural Funds because their governments have failed to comply with the habitats directive ?
That is the balance I suppose .
- The question on how the Structural Funds respect our environmental legislation is a critical one and I appreciate the interest expressed in this matter by Mrs Jackson , Mr Poettering and Mrs Schnellhardt .
We had a discussion on this subject in the Commission meeting today particularly as regards the link to the habitats and the birds directives .
The main principle is clear : the actions cofinanced under the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund should contribute to the protection and improvement of the environment in the European Union .
This is confirmed in the new regulatory framework for the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund and in the Commission 's related guidelines .
We should remember that both the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds finance important investments into environmental infrastructure such as waste water treatment facilities or waste management systems .
Let me make one thing clear first to avoid misunderstandings .
The general regulation on the Structural Funds states that ' operations financed must be in conformity with the provisions of the Treaty , with instruments adopted under it and with Community policies and actions ' .
Contrary to the suggestion in one of the oral questions , this does not represent a new obligation on the Member States .
In fact , it is based closely on the previous framework regulation on the Structural Funds for the programming period 1994-1999 .
The Structural Funds Regulation has been approved by the Member States and the Council .
This is what we confirmed in the Commission this afternoon , and Michel Barnier will set out our decisions in a letter to the Member States in a few days .
In this regard , the Commission intends to use all the possibilities offered by the new regulatory framework for the Cohesion and Structural Funds .
The Commission will then use all the means at its disposal to ensure that commitments entered into the programming documents are fully respected .
It intends to monitor the situation in the Member States , including the use of on-the-spot checks .
The Commission 's representative in the monitoring committee for each programme will also seek to ensure that Member States ' obligations with regard to Natura 2000 are fully respected .
In addition , should a Member State not honour its commitment to provide the lists under the habitats and birds directives within the timeframe set in the programming documents , the Commission will take immediate action .
This includes in particular excepting specific situations and with respect to the principle of proportionality - possible recourse to the provisions of the Structural or Cohesion Fund regulations in relation to the suspension of payments .
Of course , all this is in addition to the ongoing infringement procedures against a number of Member States for their failure to implement these directives .
We will use the means at our disposal to ensure that they honour the commitments that they have entered into .
Without the lists neither the Member States nor the Commission can ensure that we protect important nature sites when carrying out Structural Fund operations , for the simple reason that we do not know where these sites are .
One more word on the habitats directive .
The Commission does not agree that there is a lack of clarity in this directive .
The directive is intended to establish a frame of reference which , in accordance with the subsidiarity principle , leaves the detailed implementation to the Member States .
While the Commission has no plans to revise the directive , its services are ready to provide guidance to the Member States on its implementation and we are finally starting to move on this .
The only sites which the Commission takes into account under the habitats directive are those put forward by the authorities in the Member States .
So-called shadow lists can only help in efforts to identify sites inside the Member States .
At Community level , they can contribute to scientific reference material in the creation of inventories of natural habitats and existing species .
You are now going back on that principle ; you are going back to the Member States to ask them to provide the lists .
They are seriously late . They have completely failed to meet the requirements of the European directives .
So , today , it is still not clear to us whether you intend to utilise the technical , legal and political means available to you in order to enforce European directives .
From reading the various reports of the European Union , and the European Environment Agency , it is clear that environmental damage is still continuing .
The question I am asking , then , is as follows : today , when accepting the draft Community support framework for Portugal , did you demand the list of protected sites under the terms of the directives ?
Mr President , my first report as an MEP was on precisely the same topic as that which we are discussing here today : the environment and the Structural Funds .
I still believe this today ; our main objective must always be sustainable development , i.e. development which respects and promotes the environment .
At the same time , however , we should avoid over-reacting . We should not suspend all the programmes or refuse to approve any of them just because we cannot guarantee that the odd regulation will be upheld .
This reminds me of a Greek proverb : you cannot chop off your head just because you have tooth ache .
I am not suggesting that we contravene legislation .
Rather , I am suggesting that we go ahead and implement the programmes and , at the same time , monitor the implementation of legislation and ensure that the Commission keeps Parliament informed .
We should also bear in mind , Mr President , that measures promoting the environment are often financed by the Structural Funds .
If we were to suspend all the programmes without exception for the reason given by a number of speakers here , we would be doing our environment more harm than good .
Mr President , there is no disagreement on the fact that we want to comply with this piece of legislation .
I was surprised to see you quoted in my press as threatening to cut off European funding .
I consider that to be a disproportionate action for what we are trying to achieve .
You will know that in the case of the UK , at a moderation seminar , the Commission agreed a timetable to allow for review and inclusion of additional sites .
In Paris a timetable was set to allow for a revised list to be presented in July with another moderation in October 2000 .
This process is ongoing and I have no reason to believe that any plans submitted for regional funding breached the EU habitats and wild bird directives at this stage .
Therefore , I fail to understand or accept the linkage that is trying to be established through this resolution .
But let us be clear .
We therefore need to have a balanced relationship between means and ends .
In the final analysis any breach of EU legislation must actually go the European Court of Justice .
I cannot accept that such a balance means the cutting off of vital lifelines of EU funds to the poorest and neediest regions .
Commissioner Barnier probably said to you today , Commissioner Wallström , that all European programmes should be able to start without undue delay because it can be extremely difficult to make up for lost time later on .
I therefore ask the Commissioner to take collective responsibility for ensuring that Structural Fund programmes are implemented in time .
That is your responsibility as a member of the college .
Unlike the last speaker I would like to congratulate you , Commissioner , on your threat to cut off European funding .
It should not just be an idle threat .
You should carry it out if Member States do not act responsibly .
I come from a Member State which benefits from European funding but I am appalled at its track record on the implementation of the wild birds directive , on the habitats directive and many other directives .
We are , per capita , the worst country as regards complaints .
It is about time the European Commission took action and decided that if you are not willing to abide by the rules then the funding has to be cut off .
If this affects my own country , then so be it .
Member States have to comply with European regulations .
You must stick to that .
If Member States are not willing to comply with the directives , cut off the funding .
I would support you one hundred percent .
On the other hand , we spend a third of our resources on the Structural Funds , but the projects funded under those funds are the first to contravene directives on habitats .
Portugal is a perfect example of what I have just been talking about , and as it is a perfect example , it merits a thorough explanation .
In other words , the Portuguese sites that already form part of the Natura 2000 network are completely at the mercy of unscrupulous groups of financiers and construction companies , because of the lack of instruments to protect them .
The most serious case is that of the tourist development that has been approved for the Abano area of the Sintra-Cascais national park , and I call on the Commission to intervene in this as a matter of urgency .
Unfortunately , what is happening in Portugal is not unique - it is merely a good example .
I therefore hope that the Commission will bring its legal authority to bear and refuse to approve any funding for the third Community support framework until Member States send in their lists for the Natura 2000 network .
Sustainable development is supposed to be about integrating economic development with environmental concerns .
That is what the EU has signed up to in countless treaties from the Rio Earth Summit onwards .
That is what Article 6 of our own EC Treaty obliges us to do - to integrate those policies .
At the heart of this debate is the issue of economic development coming right up against environmental constraints .
We are going to be increasingly faced with hard decisions on this .
It will be a very good test of what our commitment to sustainable development really means .
At a recent plenary session , we talked a lot about coherence in EU policies .
Members from all over this House were rightly emphasising how important policy coherence is , yet here we have an outstanding example of policy incoherence .
That is why the Greens are supporting very strongly this resolution from the Environment Committee .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have listened to your address very carefully , but I have not fully understood it .
I will read the communication from the Commission very carefully , but perhaps you can help me to understand matters .
Are you of the opinion that the Commission can block entire approvals for plans , or is it just payment of funds for individual projects ?
That was not at all clear .
Let me say two or three things .
Firstly , I think that Community law must be seen as a whole .
Community law provides that if a Member State fails to implement legislation , or implements it incorrectly , the State will be brought to justice .
You should do that !
You should not try to achieve through the back door , through the non-payment of money , what you are unable to achieve through legal action and orderly process .
This is something which I do not think is quite right .
If you are saying that Member States are contravening Community law , breaching Community law , then bring these Member States to justice !
Secondly , Commissioner , the Structural Funds are not given out to damage the countryside .
They are given out to create jobs and to kick-start the regions .
We must not therefore , in order to achieve another objective , obstruct or abandon the original aim of supporting disadvantaged areas .
What is more , it should not be the case that one Commissioner sets himself up as some sort of Supreme Commissioner who can then dictate to the other .
None of us want anything for the environment to be left undone .
But it isn ' t on , Mr President , Commissioner , that regions might suffer because Member States are failing in their duties !
Here too we must watch out !
Mr President , I believe the issue of ensuring integrated and correct implementation of the Community ' s environmental policy is perhaps the greatest challenge facing the Member States today .
Unfortunately , however , the requirements of environmental policy are not being respected and are not being properly incorporated when programmes and projects are formulated and approved in the Member States .
I should just like to draw your attention to paragraph b and point 3 and 8 of the resolution which takes account of precisely this issue .
It is absurd for EU environmental legislation not to be applied or respected for all projects in the Member States , irrespective of whether they require Community or some other type of funding .
This flagrant violation of our basic environmental laws must not be allowed to continue .
We need , once and for all , to come out and say what is happening in the Member States , because transparency , courage and the truth are the best policy .
And the truth is that the directives for the Natura 2000 network have been inadequately implemented both in my country and in other Member States .
Mr President , I cannot resist starting by saying it is well-known that my Irish colleague across the way lives in the capital city of Dublin where these sites will not be troubling her too much .
No Member State has fully met the requirements of the habitats directive , for example , let alone met them within the legally-binding timetable .
Commission procedures are under way against nearly every Member State - 12 Member States in fact - under the habitats directive at the moment .
Twelve European countries are before the European Court .
The wild birds directive is little better with 13 countries currently facing a legal challenge for failure to comply with the directive 20 years after it was agreed .
Constitutional challenge is often quoted in Ireland as one of our reasons .
Indeed our written constitution with protection for property rights has proved very difficult for the government to get over many of the issues in relation to designation of sites .
But with the principle of proportionality well respected , proposals to use the structural funds in this regard will help countries like Ireland to focus on what they actually need to do .
Perhaps you will take those on board in items 2 and 3 of the motion .
Mr President , Commissioner , implementation of the flora-fauna-habitats directive is causing quite a stir in many regions and also running into major difficulties .
Vaguely formulated application criteria are also the cause of the nine-year plus delay in implementation .
In my home region , a dialogue was begun prior to identification of the FFH sites .
The process brought the following problems to light in particular .
Small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises are experiencing a restriction in the utilisation and cultivation of arable and grazing land as a result of the directive .
This means indirectly a reduction in the value of this land .
In municipal areas the directive in its current form is leading to the obstruction of important infrastructure measures .
Without any doubt , this cannot be in the interests of the Commission .
It would be sensible to re-examine and revise Directive 9243 to provide more certainty and clarity .
Citizens have the right to know the consequences which they can expect .
Before notifying a site an owner must know which conservation objectives will be achieved using which measures .
For this reason , I ask that you support the amendment which I have tabled jointly with Mr Schnellhardt .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a few final comments .
This is not about the implementation of the habitats directive .
Remember that the directive is not an effort directive , it is a result directive .
This is about meeting our obligations under the Structural Funds regulation and without these lists we cannot ensure that we protect important natural sites during Structural Funds operations .
That is what this is about .
If for example in a country which we have discussed today there are 40 projects currently under way that would affect sites to be protected , how can we check that if we have not got the lists ?
It is the obligation of the Commission to ensure that these sites are protected .
So does this mean that we will not approve the operational programmes to answer your question ?
We are reasonable .
That is a clear timetable .
If they do not do so , we will launch the procedure for suspending payments without delay .
That is the decision we have taken today .
To make it very clear also to Mrs Isler Beguin that means that what was written in the common letter by Mrs Bjerregaard and Mrs Wulf-Mathies is still valid .
We have to understand that this is an opportunity for us to live up to our obligations under the regulations for the Structural Funds .
This will be a very important tool .
Of course , we hope that this will not be necessary because the Member States will provide us with their lists .
That is what we have to hope for and maybe pray for too .
I have received one motion for resolution pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
( The sitting was closed at 12.09 a.m. )
Mrs Maes has the floor for a point of order .
Maes ( Verts / ALE ) .
( NL ) Mr President , Parliament has been informed of some correspondence between Mr Prodi and Mrs Fontaine , in her capacity as President of this Parliament .
In his letter , he levelled heavy criticism at our Committee on Budgetary Control regarding the way it carries out its function .
We have not received a reply from Mrs Fontaine yet , but you will understand - and your presidency will feel the same - that this letter has caused a great deal of consternation , to put it mildly .
Mr Prodi has also written a letter to Mr Söderman in which he criticised the way in which Mr Söderman thinks he should exercise his duties .
Mr Söderman has replied to this letter , and we do have this reply .
We would like to know how the presidency has dealt with this correspondence .
Mrs Maes , the issue you have raised will be studied by the Presidency and the Conference of Presidents immediately .
50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention - humanitarian law
The next item is the Council statement on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention - humanitarian law .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , just a few months ago we marked the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on the protection of victims of armed conflicts .
Fifty years ago , 63 countries signed the four conventions and two protocols which still provide a basis for international humanitarian rights today .
Events since that time have demonstrated that those who considered it essential to strengthen the rights of individuals in war zones , including civilians and military personnel not directly involved in the conflict , were totally justified .
We are still continuing to witness acts of war marked by barbarism and a total denial of the rights of civilians and of military personnel outside combat zones .
The behaviour of many states and many parties to armed conflicts fails to reflect any principles whatsoever and is characterised by an " end justifies the means " approach .
And it is not unusual for civilians to be the particular target of military action , either in the form of terrorism or as an instrument of political pressure .
In cases of this kind , acts affecting more vulnerable social groups take on a particular importance and are even more shocking .
It is important to carry on strengthening these organisations ' freedom of action and the protection of humanitarian workers .
In this context , I would particularly like to draw attention to the International Committee of the Red Cross , whose reports demonstrate that specific action is needed to improve the way in which the Geneva Conventions are applied .
In the context of its external relations , the Union promotes these values and seeks to implement them at all times through its political actions .
We are therefore alert to any risk of weakening the principles that unite us in this area , and we have always denounced any violations through our common foreign and security policy .
In such cases we seek to use the instruments available to us to exert pressure in a timely and effective way .
We are aware that in many cases we have not achieved everything we might wish , but we firmly intend to continue in future with the same determination .
This hope is primarily founded on gradually establishing an international set of values which means that it is already becoming difficult to take refuge behind spurious criteria such as cultural differences and national traits .
These people must start to realise that the world is no longer a place where impunity is the rule .
If we can get this message across , we will certainly be helping to strengthen human rights and to give the principles which the Geneva Conventions and their protocols aim to protect the credibility and effectiveness that they need .
The more suffering we prevent , the less action we will then have to take to repair the great damage caused by war .
What more can be done therefore to increase compliance with international humanitarian law and thus limit the suffering of the victims ?
For example , we can spread the knowledge of this law , particularly throughout society itself , amongst young people , within mass organisations and also in the armed forces and security services .
Above all , we must , through education , instil a passion for peace amongst our citizens .
Amongst these organisations , we should highlight the International Committee of the Red Cross .
All the institutions of the European Union must decisively support the work of the ICRC , because their role is quite simply indispensable .
For all these reasons , Mr President , I ask you to support the resolution tabled , which contains all the main elements of the proposal presented by the Socialist Group at the end of last year .
Mr President , 12 August 1949 is a day which the ancient Romans would have said should be marked with a red stone .
We have failed to spread the lessons and values learned from that conflict .
We have failed to educate against the glorification of combat in our own communities .
We have failed to educate against the problems and the scourge of racism and xenophobia .
Yet , thanks to global communications , we have a constant reminder now on our television screens of the terrible effects of man 's inhumanity to man , and of course to woman and child .
We need to be pushing for the creation of a permanent international criminal court and urging our own Member States to sign and ratify the Convention .
We need to be working hard to combat racism and xenophobia .
Mr President , I am in sincere agreement with what was said in the previous speech .
Yesterday , we were talking about a Charter of Fundamental Rights ; today we are speaking of human rights .
Yesterday , in one excellent speech , someone said that we have a moral obligation to defend and develop democracy and human rights .
What this moral obligation actually entails and the extent of our efforts and commitment will , however , come to light in the context of that wretched reality represented by wars and armed conflicts .
Over the last century , these have totally changed in nature .
Humanitarian law is that yardstick by which we can show whether that moral obligation is just some kind of rhetorical stimulus for us or something that leads to deeds and action .
Today we are hearing the case of Albin Kurti , of Kosovo .
The Geneva Conventions are a vital part of this minimum level of action .
We also have to ensure that both the Ottawa Convention against Land Mines and the Charter for an International Criminal Court are ratified .
Mr President , a European delegation returning from Chechnya a few days ago reported terrible sights .
We must ask for some consistency between the countries of Europe if we want to make a genuine stand for human rights .
Mr President , I would like to start by apologising for the absence of Lord Bethell , our first speaker .
He must be held up somewhere for he is usually very conscientious .
As he was not here this morning , I will , in effect , be taking over his task of first speaker .
Mr President , I would like to thank you for the declaration by the Portuguese presidency and also for the Commission ' s declaration .
I would also like to congratulate the Portuguese presidency because once again , it appears that it attended virtually all important debates this week .
Not all presidencies do this but the Portuguese do , and I think , therefore , that they deserve a compliment for this .
Mr President , the Geneva Convention is more topical than ever , especially in light of the events of the past couple of years .
In Kosovo , hundreds of thousands of people have been forced out of their homes because they belonged to the wrong ethnic group .
The same has happened in the rest of former Yugoslavia since the early nineties .
Never again . This is what politicians decided in post-war Europe .
And this is how European cooperation and the Geneva Convention came about .
For a long time , we thought that Europe would remain spared of this kind of adversity and that we had sufficient instruments in place to prevent this kind of brutal disaster .
This appeared not to be the case .
Yugoslavia proved that Europe will remain vulnerable as long as the Union limits itself in scope to Western Europe .
The task of the European Union is therefore to extend the system we have created to the whole of Europe , above all with a view to keeping the peace .
It is just as important to look at the world around us . Take Chechnya , where the population is the victim of a battle between the Russian army and terrorists .
Or Asia , Burma , in particular , where entire groups of the population are being driven out of their traditional areas with military force .
Indonesia , Timor , but also the Moluccas , where hundreds of thousands of people are forced out of their homes with the active backing of the army - yet again .
Sudan , where the southern population has been on the run from the northern rulers for years and where martial law is ignored .
The Great Lake areas in Africa where the fight between the Hutus and the Tutsis , an ethnic battle if ever I saw one , has forced millions of people to flee .
They are increasingly beleaguered rather than being protected by the national army units .
Nobody seems to be taking any notice of this problem .
This is only an outline of the problems , both within Europe and elsewhere , which occasioned the drafting of the Geneva Convention .
The fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Convention has actually been written in blood if we consider these fateful events .
At the same time , the Geneva Convention is also a beacon because we now have a tool by means of which we can expose inhumanities and because we can also report on positive developments .
One of these positive developments is the European Union itself where - to quote President Mitterrand , who spoke here - after 400 years of war , we have enjoyed more than 40 years ' peace .
Prominent politicians , some of whom , in fact most of whom , come from within our circles , have helped to bring this about .
We recently witnessed a huge humanitarian disaster brought about by a supposedly humanitarian intervention .
Nearly 50 % of infants born prematurely die .
The children being born are underdeveloped due to malnutrition .
There has been a dramatic increase in the number of abortions .
Women are dying due to a lack of rudimentary medical care in clinics which have no electricity , heating or water .
Mr President , the symbol of the Red Cross / Red Crescent movement brings hope to battlefields worldwide .
Perhaps I could be allowed a special reason for celebrating these conventions , as one of my family members founded the British Red Cross movement .
Article 1 ( b ) of the relevant Convention forbids the taking of hostages .
Article 23 of the Universal Islamic Declaration of Human Rights says that no one shall be forced to leave the country of his residence or be arbitrarily deported therefrom .
Millions of people are suffering worldwide .
Speakers today , from Graham Watson onwards , have made those points earlier .
But let us think just of a few people in order to bring home the horror and suffering .
We recall that on 20 August 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait in a unilateral act of aggression that was universally condemned .
Nine years later , more than 600 prisoners of war are unreleased and unaccounted for by Iraq .
Iraq is a formidable enemy .
Her strength and power for evil purposes is matched only by her determination not to find the missing prisoners .
After nine years she has only provided information sufficient to close three files .
This afternoon , when we debate Iraq , do not forget the missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war .
Do not lift economic sanctions while their fate remains uncertain .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , members of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I can only applaud the Council ' s presence in this debate .
I echo without hesitation the encouraging words which the President-in-Office has just spoken . However , I need to get something off my chest .
This , I deeply regret .
However , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like to use this opportunity to bring to your attention once more the fate of the Kosovar prisoners in Serbian prisons .
Parliament has brought the fate of these prisoners to the public ' s attention three times since our appointment in July and has also asked the Council to act in this matter .
The situation in Kosovo has got considerably worse , not least because the Albanians are concerned about the fate of their fellow countrymen in Serbian prisons .
The situation in Serbia is becoming more and more absurd .
Last Monday , the Albanian student leader , Albin Kurti , was sentenced to fifteen years ' imprisonment , simply because he had organised first-aid courses after the bombardments .
This was considered helping the UCK !
Surely this is too absurd for words !
Meanwhile , the population remains very concerned about the fate of those in prison .
There are reports of torture .
The Milosevic regime is also stepping up the repression of Serbia ' s own opposition .
Mr President-in-Office , could I ask you once more to act upon the resolutions which this Parliament has adopted three times and may I ask you what you intend to do ?
Mr President , human rights are individual rights which have found their way into national constitutions and international agreements as universal and inalienable rights or standards .
They include the right to personal and political freedom and basic social and economic rights .
The idea of human rights is one of the most exalted ideas which mankind has ever had and has its roots in the concentration camps and gulags of the last century .
It appeals to everything which makes man a human being and which makes him aware of his dignity , uniqueness , freedom and equality with other men .
The way in which human rights have spread illustrates the fact that this human image has huge powers to project and concern for human dignity is at the core of any human rights policy .
50 years after the general declaration of human rights , there is still a huge gap between what we claim and what is real .
Respect for human rights is extremely important on both moral and political grounds .
There is a vicious circle .
Lasting economic success is impossible without respect for human rights and without the guarantees of the rule of law and the constitutional state .
Failure to respect human rights brings the threat of both strife and economic and social decline .
And if the development spiral turns downwards , then human rights are dragged down with it .
Respect for human rights is fundamental if conflict is to be prevented and peace consolidated .
Trampling over human rights today paves the way for conflict tomorrow .
Governments held to democratic account generally take more trouble over the welfare of their people .
Here the promotion of democracy is the first rule , combined with principles of tolerance and pluralism ; not a pluralism which is free from values , but a pluralism geared precisely towards these human rights .
It makes no difference if people are destroyed in the name of a race or a class .
There is no political excuse for oppressing people , be it from an extreme right-wing or an extreme left-wing point of view .
In a globalised world , human rights are no longer an internal affair and the general acknowledgement of the globalisation of human rights therefore needs to be strengthened further .
Human rights are indivisible .
The universality of human rights shows that the degree to which they are applied has become a measure of progress , civilisation and culture in politics and society .
As a global actor , the European Union must take greater account of human rights , both at home and abroad , in the form of a stronger human rights policy .
It must prove itself to be a community of values .
It must act preventatively within the scope of its foreign and security policy and its development policy and must react by applying sanctions , for example , by suspending assistance .
In this respect , a global human rights policy is increasingly becoming a central aspect of foreign policy .
But more responsible human rights policies need to start at home .
This means that democrats must stand together in fundamental consensus against any form of extremism , not only against right-wing , but also against left-wing extremists .
I agree with Mr Martínez when he stressed the importance of providing adequate protection and support for victims .
However we must also take action to ensure that there are fewer victims in the future .
The one sure way to achieve this is to send a clear message to those who are guilty of crimes against humanity that they will be brought to justice for their evil deeds .
The tribunals in which those guilty of atrocities in the Balkans are currently on trial send one clear message .
Furthermore , although it ended in something of a fiasco , the Pinochet case in the UK had positive aspects to it .
The groundbreaking ruling by the House of Lords illustrates one way in which concerned countries can demonstrate to those that commit crimes against humanity that there will be no hiding place for them .
However welcome some of these developments may be , more needs to be done .
They must be built upon and the establishment of the International Criminal Court was a significant development in the field of human rights .
However , it will symbolise little more than a statement of platitudes and empty rhetoric unless its Statute comes into force .
Ratification by sixty Member States is required to achieve this and of the seven that have done so I regret to say that only one is from the EU , namely Italy .
They must ratify the Rome Statute and you should use whatever influence you have elsewhere in the world to achieve that magic target of sixty to ensure that the statute of the International Criminal Court comes into force .
- ( DA ) Mr President , I completely support the Council ' s statement to the effect that the Geneva Conventions have been a very important stage in the development of humanitarian legislation .
I also agree that the conventions are just as necessary today as they were 50 years ago .
In my view , there are at present two main problems connected with the Geneva Conventions .
First of all , there is a gulf between the principles and their observance and , secondly , there are crucial states of affairs which are not covered by the conventions .
That is essentially the reverse of the situation during the First World War .
The widening gulf between principles and practice is due , in my opinion , to the fact that the character of wars has changed during the last 50 years .
More and more wars are fought under conditions of anarchy in which there are no stable structures and in which the areas hit by war are not controlled by any government .
The world has also witnessed a growing number of wars in which weapons have deliberately been aimed at civilians and the purpose of which has been to annihilate specific groups in society .
In these situations , humanitarian aid to victims is naturally unwelcome , and this leaves the world in a terrible dilemma .
The second problem is that the Geneva Conventions do not adequately deal with the activities of those who intervene for humanitarian reasons .
Even though the Geneva Conventions contain provisions concerning the right to provide humanitarian aid in crisis situations , it is also laid down that this right requires the consent of the government in the country concerned .
This is especially the case if it is a question of internal conflicts .
This is a serious breach of the humanitarian principle and is , in some cases , a fatal shortcoming which is responsible for many war victims .
It was precisely this question of providing normal access to humanitarian organisations that was the focal point of my visit to Chechnya at the beginning of February .
In my view , the question of to what extent circumstances require a revision of the Geneva Conventions , and what form this should take , is now an important one .
I believe we have two options which are not mutually exclusive .
The first is to change the conventions so that they are better placed to tackle complex contemporary crises , for example by establishing the right to provide humanitarian aid to those in need .
The other option is to ensure that the humanitarian principles established in the Geneva Conventions are in actual fact observed , for example , by improving the mechanisms for enforcing them .
But allow me to say clearly that I am wholeheartedly in favour of establishing the principle of humanitarian access in all situations and of reinforcing the right of those in distress to receive humanitarian aid .
With regard to the other option - that of securing better observance of the existing principles - I think that prosecuting offenders is one of the most promising options to be pursued .
The obligation upon States to proceed against war criminals is established in the Geneva Conventions , but that is clearly not enough .
I therefore wholeheartedly support the demand for prompt ratification of the statute of the International Criminal Court .
This demand has also been put forward here today .
On behalf of the Commission , I want to give my support to the view that we ought to work together on bringing this task to a satisfactory conclusion and turning it into legal reality .
Thank you very much , Mr Nielson .
I have received 4 motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
Human rights , racism , xenophobia and antisemitism
The next item is the joint debate on :
Mr President , it has now been 50 years since we adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
After the horrors of the Second World War , many surely felt a strong sense of hope for a better world and a more humane future .
Unfortunately , these hopes have , in many respects , been dashed .
A large proportion of the world 's population is still living under oppression , with many deprived of their basic rights .
We read daily of gross violations of human rights on grounds of gender , religion , ethnic origin , political views , sexual orientation etc .
The European Community was formed in order to prevent the atrocities of the Second World War from occurring again .
The EC became more than just an economic union ; it became an important common value-system based precisely on the respect for human rights .
Both internal work and foreign policy rest on this principle .
The European Parliament has always considered the promotion of these rights to be one of its most important tasks . This work has become even more important as time has gone by .
No one can fail to appreciate the commitment found , for example , in this House .
In many respects , the EU has a good policy on human rights but , unfortunately , it is much too ' straggly ' and incoherent .
The EU is therefore in desperate need of a coordinated , strategic and consistent policy in this area .
The Council 's report that came out in October last year was a good first step .
This was a welcome report which Parliament had waited many years for , and which we hope to see more of .
It is important , but it contains several deficiencies and needs to be supplemented .
In my opinion some of these deficiencies are linked to structural barriers and precisely this lack of a common strategy within the EU in the area of human rights .
We need increased coordination , not just between the institutions of the EU , but also between the EU and the Member States .
Human rights must be integrated into the EU 's activities naturally : in aid , in trade , in economic , cultural and political cooperation .
We need a consistent policy that is credible and predictable .
The EU must speak with one voice and give consistent signals to the countries that violate human rights .
There must be no doubt about what the EU stands for .
Certain basic rights are universal .
Violations of these can therefore never be excused on grounds of religion , culture or tradition .
Serious violations , which are specified in international conventions cannot - must not - be treated as internal matters .
Therefore , I want to encourage the Council to draw up a strategy for improving the work and making it better defined and hopefully more successful .
A few suggestions that may be included in such a strategy are , for example , that the Council could develop its own human rights indicators that could be used in connection with trade agreements .
These clauses can be used constructively , but they need to be more closely defined with respect to application , implementation and sanctions .
We could also form an advisory group containing representatives from the different EU institutions .
They could meet on a regular basis to discuss the promotion of human rights in the short and long term .
There ought to be experts in the EU 's delegations in third countries .
We must work more systematically to collect and evaluate data , information and background material . We need an early warning system for violations of human rights .
I would also like to say a few words about women 's rights , an issue that I have chosen as a special theme in the report .
The Commission declared 1999 to be the year for combating violence against women .
It was a praiseworthy initiative , but the campaign was discreet to say the least .
We need long-term work , not occasional campaigns .
Women 's rights are being systematically violated throughout the world .
Reports abound on violence in the home , rapes , ritual violence and maltreatment in prisons .
During the 1990s , rape was used systematically as an act of war in many armed conflicts .
This can now be a matter for examination in the International Criminal Court .
Rape is at present the world 's most common crime of violence .
Reports from the UN claim that , every year , more women die from the effects of violence in the home than as a result of traffic accidents , malaria , cancer or war put together .
The trade in women and children is increasing at an alarming rate .
In certain countries , the governments are employing a pure apartheid policy against women .
Thousands of young women suffer genital mutilation every day .
The issue must be dealt with in diplomatic relations and raised with the candidate countries in the course of the negotiations relating to the enlargement of the EU .
The countries of the EU must ratify the report of the proceedings of the International Criminal Court as soon as possible so that it can start work .
The EU can play an important part when it comes to encouraging countries to ratify different international conventions for the protection of human rights .
Allow me to conclude by saying that the reports that will be discussed after mine show that there are also violations of human rights within the EU .
Obviously we need to deal with this . If we want to be credible internally , we also need to have a sound policy externally .
Mr President , human rights are not something we have simply pulled out of the ether , nor have we taken them from party manifestos .
They are universal , that is to say indivisible and independent of countries and parties .
They are concerned not with opinions but with actions . They provide protection against injustice and discrimination .
They should be clear and comprehensible and not consist of idle talk .
The EU should not be changing or reinventing things .
The aforesaid legal practice is not static .
Fortunately , it is developing the whole time . Think of the latest judgement on homosexual equality , which has caused Great Britain to change its legislation , and the same will hopefully happen soon in Austria .
The conventions too are constantly being supplemented .
We have obtained conventions on bio-ethics and on the protection of personal data and private life , but I should especially like today to draw your attention to two new conventions from 1995 and 1998 concerning national minorities .
I think that Bosnia and Kosovo have taught us all that national minorities constitute the most potentially explosive factor in the Europe of the future .
The new Member States should not only comply with these requirements at the present time .
They should also guarantee that they will do so in the future and should therefore sign and ratify the conventions , as they would also wish to do , if they have not already done so .
But so too must the present Member States .
Let us therefore urgently entreat those countries which have not ratified these conventions on national minorities to see to it that this is done straight away .
Now , I think , they should put matters in order in their own countries and get these conventions signed .
The demands we impose upon others we must also impose upon ourselves .
We must say to all fifteen governments : go home and get the conventions signed and ratified .
Remember , too , the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and remember the Convention for the International War Crimes Tribunal , which only Italy has ratified .
If only half of what is stated in the reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch is correct , then the situation regarding the treatment of asylum seekers is indefensible .
I could also mention children ' s rights , which are a huge problem , including in a number of candidate States .
I would also mention my proposal that we should have a supervisory body responsible for monitoring effectively the protection of personal data and the right to private life .
Technology is developing and so too , therefore , must our instruments for the protection of human rights .
Mr President , this report builds on previous excellent work in the European Parliament and other EU institutions .
Its starting point is the European Year Against Racism 1997 but the context has moved on significantly .
I very much welcome the positioning of the fight against race discrimination firmly in a human rights context by placing it in this joint debate because that is very much the approach taken in this report .
The first theme highlighted is that in the last year we have established two facts in law and in practice .
The first is the legal competence of the European Union to fight racism .
The second is the fact that race discrimination is a breach of a fundamental right and European Union law .
The second theme emphasised in my report is to positively welcome diversity as a source of social vitality , economic prosperity and international influence .
European identity is not a homogenous white culture and it can , and must , expand to encompass the experience and culture of minority communities .
Thirdly my report notes that racial prejudice and discrimination poisons our whole society , including for white people .
Surveys show that racism has increased and there is an increase in racist violence and support for extremist parties .
On the other hand there is also progress , however bumpy , and some regions and cities in Europe are becoming at ease with a multi-racial and multi-cultural way of life .
I would cite London , which I represent , as the multi-racial capital of Europe .
Certainly I believe we need to talk a lot about racism and diversity and identity , not sideline the issues or talk in code .
Some may find the language in my report blunt and it is certainly intended to be clear and unambiguous .
Could I just address three aspects which I understand caused some difficulty for some Members of the EPP-ED Group .
The first is the mention of Austria and the entry of Haider ' s party into government and recalling the Parliament ' s decision in February .
The second area where there are apparently EPP-ED hesitations is regarding enhanced rights for legally resident third country nationals of which there are around 20 million in the Union .
My understanding is that there is nothing in this report that the EPP has not been able to accept in the past .
The third area which I understand creates some problems for the EPP-ED Group is the belief that this report breaches subsidiarity by mentioning matters like education and policing .
There are a few of the EPP-ED amendments which I can accept although it is perhaps a pity that they did not make more input at committee stage .
Could I appeal to Members of that group to deal with their points of disagreement by making explanations of vote .
I believe this report will get majority support here in plenary .
It was adopted by a large majority in committee and some of the supporters of the Conservatives and Christian Democrats may not appreciate their failure to be part of that majority .
Could I just finally say that I can accept some of the amendments from the Green Group and the GUE , particularly the one which I welcome to replace the term " holocaust " by " Shoah " .
It is not in order to identify discrimination and I hope they will understand if I reject their amendments on that .
I hope very much that the report will get a large majority when it is voted on later .
Mr President , racism , xenophobia and antisemitism are completely incompatible with the European Union ' s political principles .
Please allow me to make a direct reference . These evil and harmful human phenomena are also completely at odds with the Bible .
Indeed , the word of God repeatedly and emphatically speaks of hospitality and mercifulness to strangers , as well as true charity as a consequence of our love for God , the Creator of all mankind .
Meanwhile , the day-to-day reality is disappointing .
Racism , xenophobia and antisemitism are realities in Eastern and Western Europe alike .
However , this situation should not lead to debilitating mutual recriminations or imputations .
Quite the opposite , in fact : a common social threat requires a common , political effort .
Hence the expediency of the Commission ' s communication in May last year and the present report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
The European Parliament sets great store by countering racism , xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate countries , as is evident from the report and opinions .
This kind of attention also requires us to look into our own hearts .
Mrs Ludford ' s report bears witness to this .
Indeed , the European Union ' s moral standards for newcomers apply just as much to the Member States themselves .
With regard to manifestations of racism , xenophobia and antisemitism , the Member States are by no means holier than thou .
The enormity of the issues affecting the Roma people in Central and Eastern Europe stands out for two reasons .
Quantitatively , because it affects several million people and qualitatively , because the very existence of this extremely diversified people is at stake .
This is the Roma issue with all its intricacies in a nutshell .
For example , how can the Roma break through the social barrier and widespread discrimination whilst maintaining their identity ?
How can they be galvanised into social involvement and into achieving the much-needed change in mentality ?
Fortunately , such profound questions are heard - officially and unofficially - within the candidate Member States .
They have led to well thought-through and promising initiatives and projects at national level , but these absorb a huge amount of funding .
In a nutshell , the EU ' s future Member States are making a direct appeal for solidarity to the current EU Members .
Or does the Western expert ' s razor-sharp criticism levelled at the European Union for its dismissive attitude towards Roma asylum-seekers cut ice after all ?
The latter injustice should certainly not be missed out from the trio of racism , xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate Member States .
In the wake of the holocaust , the systematic mass murder of millions of European Jews , antisemitism has still not disappeared from Central and Eastern Europe .
Extreme left and extreme right did not - and still do not - shrink from using this execrable and pernicious political instrument of battle .
Indeed , antisemitism does not appear to bear any relevance to the numerical presence of Jews .
For example , demagogues will take pleasure in pointing out the Jewish background - founded or not , as the case may be - of their hated political rivals .
Still less credible are the conspiracy ideas cooked up by the ultra-nationalist grouping where the so-called traditional enemies , i.e. the national minorities in various candidate countries , are systematically associated with Jews .
In this light , Jews and Hungarians are seen as traitors of the mother country in Romania .
The same goes for Jews and Germans , and for Jews and Czechs in Czechoslovakia , Jews and Germans in Poland and Jews and Turks in Bulgaria .
Paragraph 32 of the draft resolution should be read against this dark background .
The amendments have been carefully weighed up within the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and quite a few have been honoured .
Mainly to avoid duplication , I will only partly support the newly tabled amendments .
All in all , the present report requires , in my opinion , regular follow-ups or continuous re-assessment .
It would mean a great deal to me if this were to be accomplished .
Mr President , I would like to welcome the passion with which Mr Belder has delivered his report on the Roma and on the East European situation .
It is the most extreme versions of racism on the edges of Europe which we are disturbed about .
In Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Hungary there were significant problems with the treatment of the Roma .
I would make two or three other very simple points .
What the Roma situation shows , what Mr Belder 's report shows , is that an extreme version of discrimination clearly exists throughout the European Union , otherwise we would not be discussing this issue .
There are many questions we must discuss : How strongly will we push the question of Article 13 ?
Do we really want race discrimination protection throughout the European Union ?
The answer is yes .
We must have it quickly and we must have comprehensive legislation .
If we look around the European institutions and Parliament , we realise there are very few faces from ethnic minorities .
That situation is improving , but ultimately we have institutions which are bereft of representation .
It is representation and other similar issues that we must now tackle .
Racism is a complex issue .
We have begun to discuss it adequately but we have so much further to go .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Malmström on her very balanced and illuminating report .
From the relevant debate within committee , it appears that Parliament supports the human rights principles unanimously , which I can only applaud .
I also back the rapporteur ' s decision to deal extensively with the women ' s rights issue .
With the sharia on the up in various parts of the world , this issue is more topical than ever .
According to reports which reached me over the past couple of days , the number of suicides among female intellectuals has risen dramatically over the past couple of weeks .
The example of Afghanistan illustrates that discrimination against women is not a cultural but a political phenomenon .
Moreover , Afghanistan is not the only country where the rights of women are violated on a massive scale .
Millions of women throughout the world are still being circumcised or married off .
In many African countries , women are not allowed to own any possessions or open a bank account without the permission of a man .
Other practices , such as polygamy or the inheriting of widows , have become untenable in an AIDS era .
It is hardly surprising that in Africa , more women than men are infected with the AIDS virus .
We must condemn all practices which lead to the mutilation or death of women .
Within the European Union , female circumcision must be made a punishable offence .
This is not a matter of tradition or culture , it is one of the basic human rights .
But the atrocities in the rest of the world should not blind us to the atrocities in our own countries .
Domestic violence is still a huge problem within the European Union . We must take a firm stance against this , which also involves prosecution .
Just as serious is the problem of white slavery : 500 000 women and girls per annum are imported to Western Europe alone .
A business which is estimated by the UNDP to be worth USD 7 billion .
A powerful and concerted effort is needed from all Member States to fight this outrageous form of trafficking in human beings .
Mr President , this report sends a powerful message to the Council and Commission .
I urge both institutions to turn it into something tangible , something concrete , and to do something constructive with it .
In any case , we will judge them on their actions , not their words .
Mr President , Commissioners , I would like to heartily congratulate the rapporteurs Mrs Malmström and Mr Haarder on excellent , systematic and innovative reports .
It is also the duty of Parliament to examine the question of human rights in the candidate countries in a systematic way .
We have the knowledge , but we need to coordinate it and ensure that it is put to use so that we can influence the enlargement of the Union in such a way that human rights are respected .
I am also very pleased that Mr Haarder took up the rights of minority groups .
It will be an historic moment if we adopt Mr Haarder 's report and call attention to the crimes and the lack of respect for the rights of minority groups that are found within the EU .
It is time to put a stop to the contradictory messages we have been giving out in this regard and which have meant that we have required more of the candidate countries than we have of ourselves .
In actual fact , I have no hesitation in saying that it will be an historic moment when we adopt Mr Haarder 's report because it would not previously have been possible .
Finally , I would like to mention another matter that is close to my heart , namely aid for the Commission 's work for children 's rights as expressed in Cecilia Malmström 's report .
The Commission needs this aid .
We ought also to give aid when it comes to allocating budget funds to work for children 's rights .
I also believe that , in this area , we need to guard against children ' s becoming a commodity .
There is also a lack of respect for the rules of the Hague Convention and , as far as this is concerned , we also have very , very serious problems in the candidate countries .
Without civil society we are living in a vacuum .
We cannot breathe unless we are motivated from outside , from grassroots level .
The report contains a number of excellent and well-considered proposals .
This is a precision weapon , which must be utilised more .
Speaking more generally , as Mrs Malmström herself also said , we have to develop a strategic approach to all the problems we are speaking about today .
It must be a dynamic one and one that can penetrate the reality of the situation at all levels .
We cannot go about correcting obvious wrongdoings by merely resorting to rhetorical commitment .
The Finnish writer Samuli Paronen wrote : " big crimes need many accomplices , millions - all those who do nothing " .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think these reports speak for themselves .
Racism and antisemitism are on the increase in the European Union and beyond .
Our first act must therefore be not only to refuse to accept this situation but to publicly denounce it .
Due to its clear-sightedness , Mrs Ludford ' s report actively contributes to this approach .
It is a crime against human dignity . It is antisocial behaviour which can include physical attacks on individuals .
On each occasion , people were given the ideological arms to carry out the attacks .
There is also another type of racism which involves daily harassment and humiliation .
This can be seen in the discrimination applied in access to housing , leisure facilities and employment .
You will all be aware of the example , recently reported in the French press , of a young man from Strasbourg who sent two completely identical curricula vitæ to the same company .
The name on one was foreign-sounding and the other was typically French .
You can guess which ' applicant ' was invited for interview .
We cannot nowadays simply defend those described as minorities . Instead we must get them out of this ghetto .
Throughout its history Europe has been capable of the best and the worst .
The best is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention . The worst is colonialism , the Shoah , Stalinism and nazism .
We must teach our children about all of this .
We must clearly embrace everything which can strengthen Europe and reject anything which weakens it . At the same time we must send a clear message about the type of society we want to build .
These people have clearly chosen their side .
All these fine words must now lead to concrete action and practical legislative steps .
Legislation against racism must be harmonised . The words must take on real meaning .
Equal opportunities means allowing all children born on European soil to become European citizens and to enjoy the right of nationality of the country in which they are born .
For example , the right to immigration does not exist .
Moreover , the idea of completely uncontrolled immigration is unimaginable , if only for reasons of space and numbers .
And , in addition , there are duties which should sometimes be remembered as well as rights .
For example , we have been talking about the Roma .
Many of them abuse their women and , more importantly , their children .
Ill-treated , ragged children are often to be seen on the streets , and this is a conscious situation calculated to arouse the pity of passers-by and to induce them to give them some money .
We must take care that we do not become a minority ourselves , and that we do not become victims of discrimination here , in our own home .
Mr President , the 1998 / 1999 annual report on respecting human rights within the EU has gone far beyond its own brief .
Too much attention has gone into developing European powers in the field of human rights , of which , by all accounts , there are high expectations .
What is remarkable , however , is the deafening silence when it comes to those who really are the weaker parties amongst us : the elderly , babies and the handicapped .
And where does the right to life come in ?
And what about the protection of the family ?
Racism , xenophobia and antisemitism must be stamped out .
I fully share this view , which is expressed in the Ludford report .
But in contrast to what is stated in the report , we cannot prevent racism and xenophobia by adopting a unilateral , positive approach to the multi-cultural society as a " source of social vitality " .
This notion smacks of a naïve kind of intellectualism .
The Netherlands has adopted such a policy over the past couple of years , aimed at bringing about a multi-cultural society .
This did not turn out to be a success , as is evident from the " multi-cultural drama " which we now find ourselves in .
Many immigrants have , as a result of this policy , ended up in a sub-class of society , with all the consequences that entails .
Finally , racism , xenophobia and antisemitism , have , I am sorry to say , existed throughout the world since time immemorial .
With this in mind , we should take the century-old Biblical commandment " love thy neighbour like thyself " to heart .
In so doing , he has confirmed my contention that this action by the 14 lacks any justifiable basis , Mr Schulz .
The report also criticises the fact that Austria has not yet ratified the 1998 European Charter for Minority Languages .
I should therefore like to point out that the ratification of the Charter for Minority Languages referred to is indeed an element of the government ' s programme .
The coalition has undertaken to table this before the Nationalrat ( National Assembly ) by January 2001 , and the highly criticised government is continuing to burnish Austria ' s already excellent image in the field of human rights .
( Applause from the right )
We have several basic principles .
We have also wanted to avoid , where possible , countries being mentioned or highlighted when the report on human rights for this year does not contain a systematic analysis of each country .
The next report to be put to the vote should be awaited with even more trepidation and should clearly show the interest which our Union takes in human rights within our Community .
Mr President , in this great debate about human rights it is surprising how infrequently we hear children mentioned - the people who are least able to protect themselves in relation to human rights .
Children are actually invisible in the EU Treaties .
Animals have rights , children do not .
Yet children are affected by the laws that the EU passes and the single market .
The electronic revolution seems to have given more freedom to exploiters , the paedophiles and the pornographers , than to industrialists .
In a twenty-first century where we regard ourselves as civilised there is still a slave trade in which children are bought and sold for sexual exploitation throughout the world .
We have problems in the candidate countries .
We have a scandal at the moment in Latvia which allegedly goes to the very heart of the government .
We have pictures on our TV almost every day of child soldiers fighting in conflicts throughout the world .
And of course , we have familiar tales of child labour .
We have to take tougher action .
We have to bring children up the agenda .
This is not to say that the EU should start to be responsible for children 's policy but we could start by ensuring that EU laws are child-proof .
We should ensure that measures developed by the Commission have a specific children 's dimension .
We should ensure that there is somebody in the Commission with responsibility for child matters .
In 1998 my own government appointed a child rights expert from Save The Children to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to develop strategies and practical projects in relation to children 's rights .
Why can we not do the same ?
We also have in Great Britain a Children 's Select Committee able to investigate child abuses and to interrogate expert witnesses .
Why can we not do the same ?
Can we make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has a section relating to children ?
I know we have communications .
We have action plans and conventions but what we want is action , not good intentions .
Mr President , why are human rights so far behind human progress ?
Science , technology and communication have broadened man ' s knowledge and expertise and abilities beyond belief .
Yet , the world is still being plagued by human rights violations on a massive scale , mainly due to war , poverty and misuse of power .
We should therefore concentrate all our efforts on these human rights .
But cultural value patterns underlie these violations too .
Mrs Malmström was therefore right in asking , in her special report , that the position of the woman be given special attention .
In a great many societies , the woman is still suffering at the hands of men as a result of institutionalised and sometimes legalised misuse of power .
Not collective habits but the effects on the individual must be the overriding factor in our judgement .
This means , for example , that we should not respect female circumcision as an old tradition but should fight it with all civilised means .
European foreign policy is too easily thrown off course by purely economic interests .
It is high time that human rights were given the priority they deserve , not only in theory but also in practice .
In this way , Europe can make a substantial contribution to progress , progress of civilisation .
Clearly , the Union ' s best tool for disseminating its human rights model is the experience of migrants .
Yet our greatest failings in human rights involve these very people .
I can give you two examples of this .
Firstly , there is cause for concern about the shape being taken by the readmission agreements which directly threaten fundamental rights such as the right of asylum or the right to live as a family .
The Union has confirmed its attachment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions by establishing the anti-deportation principle .
What image of human rights do you think they will take back to their countries given their experiences of questionable living conditions , humiliating body searches , insults , endless forms and interrogations in police stations and detention centres ?
After all this , we then just end up sending them back to countries which they are legitimately seeking to leave , often for political and economic as well as humanitarian reasons .
These readmission agreements are dangerous for asylum-seekers , for the dissemination of human rights throughout the world and for the international stature of the European Union .
Another flagrant attack on human rights concerns foreigners and citizenship .
At a time when the Union is considering the definition of a Charter of Fundamental Rights , why are we creating second-class citizens ?
This really is a case of fundamental rights .
How can we allow some people to be excluded ?
How can they believe in the reality of the Declaration of Human Rights ?
On human rights , the Union could take pride in being the first in history to define citizenship according to a principle of residence instead of establishing discrimination based on nationality .
Mr President , this debate is taking place at an important moment for this Parliament .
The excellent reports by Mrs Malmström , Mrs Ludford and Messrs Haarder and Belder offer us Europeans the opportunity for analysis and , above all , self-criticism .
This year is especially significant .
A year after waging war against Yugoslavia in the name of human rights , we have remained passive in the face of an even greater violation of these rights on the part of Russia in Chechnya .
Two weeks ago , with the support of the United States , Spain and Great Britain allowed Pinochet to evade his responsibilities to face justice for his very grave violations of human rights .
This year we have also seen a racist and xenophobic party enter government in Austria , and in Spain we have also seen an outbreak of racist violence in El Ejido .
We have seen the mayor of that city receive 75 % support in the elections there .
This has also been the year in which the Catholic Church has issued a mea culpa on violations of human rights committed throughout history .
To this end , we in the European Union could develop a more constructive attitude .
I therefore propose five points , which are the contributions of the GUE / NGL Group to the various reports .
It is not so much a question of what is said , and the more talk there is of human rights , the worse are the abuses .
I want to make three small points .
The second point is an extension of yesterday ' s debate .
It is said that the more rights we have , the better , but rights are part and parcel of a complicated interplay of systems .
The result of an EU Charter would be an endlessly complicated morass of legal and constitutional problems .
Which is the decision-making authority ?
Are the rights guaranteed under the Convention on Human Rights better than those guaranteed under the EU ' s Charter ?
Is the latter , again , better than the national constitutions ?
That is a question which has no meaning .
Finally , my third remark is a compliment to the rapporteur , Mr Haarder .
It is with satisfaction and much interest that I see that paragraph 61 emphasises the collective right to trade union membership .
However , Mr Haarder ' s old hobbyhorse about the individual ' s right not to join a union is not included as a recommendation .
I want to congratulate Mr Haarder on the new political insight on his part which is evidenced here .
Mr President , the report contains important conditions for future candidate countries , thereby granting human rights problems the same status as economic conditions .
We particularly welcome the fact that the problem of religious freedom was mentioned , as some countries , especially the Czech Republic , have already passed very restrictive laws against religious minorities .
The passage on the human rights situation within the EU is also interesting and gives the EU no cause whatsoever to take the moral high ground vis-à-vis new candidate countries .
We Austrians now find ourselves in a situation , ostensibly in order to safeguard human rights , in which we no longer know whether to laugh or cry .
A few weeks ago , taxi drivers in Brussels were refusing to take Austrian passengers .
Austrians were thrown out of hotels and restaurants in Belgium and France .
Our assistants ' French teachers declared that they no longer wished to teach Nazis and school exchange programmes were cancelled .
Austrians working abroad had their cars vandalised , stones thrown at their houses and their children were threatened at school .
Today it was revealed that the Austrian entrant in a show jumping competition in Grenoble had his invitation withdrawn .
The town council in Grenoble held lengthy discussions on whether or not the horse was welcome but , in the end , its invitation was also withdrawn as it had not expressly distanced itself from the Austrian government .
Perhaps we shall soon see Mozart banned from international opera houses .
Who knows where it will all end .
Whoever takes political responsibility for this anti-fascist Punch and Judy show here in the House and in the EU countries in question has cause to be proud .
I can assure the previous speakers , who call me Satan ' s sidekick , that I am not hiding a cloven hoof beneath the benches .
If this irrational collective hatred against an entire nation can be so readily called upon in the EU , we are a long way from being in a position to dictate to other countries .
If only all these good people who take the floor here had lived sixty or more years ago , just think what Europe could have spared itself .
Yet Europe is trying to build itself without this basic element and even to destroy this through its two fundamental aspects , namely res publica and sovereignty .
It is not by chance that the Declaration of Human Rights coincided in France with the affirmation of national sovereignty .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I read the Ludford report with great interest and I would like to compliment the rapporteur on her remarks on Austria and the Austrian situation .
However , I would stress that these remarks are out of place in a report on human rights .
I would like to say something else on the subject of this report , regarding the right of Europeans to their own identity .
Throughout the document , the identity of Europeans , of the European nations , is not once referred to in a positive sense but always as a possible framework for xenophobia and racism .
I am a practising Christian who is sure of his beliefs : now , is this a reason to accuse me of xenophobia ?
On the contrary , xenophobia is more likely to be caused by a decline in religious convictions . Religion per se is a factor which promotes fraternity .
I am a staunch Italian patriot , so , according to paragraph O of this document , I could be accused of xenophobia .
We must make it clear that Europe does have a cultural identity , based on our Greek and Judo-Christian heritages and on enlightenment , which enters freely into dialogue with other identities .
A multicultural Europe which does not include European culture would lead to disaster and its decline .
This is not a not a question of black or white cultures : there is no connection between colour and culture . Culture is based on values , not colour .
There are many issues related to xenophobia and racism , but these must be dealt with by the local communities .
It is not our place to define labour market quotas , or police or any other labour market quotas , and if we were to do so we would hinder integration , not encourage it .
Lastly , are we really of the opinion that all those who are not in favour of completely uncontrolled immigration are racist ?
And do we really think that the Constitutions of all of our nations are racist because their criteria are different from those espoused by Baroness Ludford ?
These aspects of the report need to be evaluated carefully and many of them changed , or we will find it hard to obtain a general consensus in this Chamber .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by offering my congratulations on Mrs Malmström ' s report to Mrs Malmström herself and to everyone who contributed to it .
It seems to me to be a very comprehensive report and to make some very striking points .
I would like to draw the House ' s attention to three key points concerning human rights as I see this issue at present .
One of these is the issue of water . The World Water Forum is about to take place in The Hague , at the end of this week to be precise .
At this event , water will be treated as a rare economic commodity .
This is serious , as whilst it may be true that water is becoming ever more important in economic terms , it is also true that the right to water is a human and social right for everyone .
I would therefore like to draw honourable Members ' attention to precisely this issue , water , which is going to be one of the most hotly debated subjects this year .
The situation is becoming ever more critical , but the right to water also has to be seen as a human right .
The second point that I would like to mention today , very briefly , is the situation in Angola .
The report says that attacks on human rights in Angola have been treated with too much diplomatic discretion .
We need to have a clearer and better informed view of events in Angola , as I said in this House when we were discussing the issue of attacks on journalists ' rights .
I refer , Mr President , to point 38 and points 41 and 42 of the Haarder report .
We have to admit , however , that we still have a lot of homework to do .
Self-criticism is not enough .
It does us credit , but alone it does not suffice .
The same applies to the way in which many refugees are treated in many Member States .
How many more times do we intend to debate the conditions in numerous detention centres as a problem of which we are aware but which has yet to be regulated ?
In this sense , thank you .
Mr President , these reports are heading in the right direction but we cannot accept the self-satisfaction of the recitals in the current treaties .
To be effective , the fight against discrimination requires broader and , in particular , more specific measures .
Therefore , any restriction linked to nationality for access to civil service jobs must be abolished .
The institutions of the Community and Member States must lead the way in this .
In the same way , full citizenship implies giving third country nationals resident in the European Union the right to vote in all elections .
As long as these third country nationals are refused political rights , they will be the target of demagogy and discrimination .
If their status as taxpayers justifies their access to this right , why limit this to the local and European levels ?
Finally , in Europe the situation of all illegal immigrants must be legalised in order to fight against the traffic in labour and the xenophobic hatred which has recently been seen , in Spain , for example .
This would mean breaking with the provisions of the Schengen , Amsterdam and Dublin Treaties which are real insults to the right of asylum .
Mr President , we can write all we like about human rights and we can report and discuss the issue , but unless we follow through on our intentions and the reports , they are meaningless .
They gather dust on the shelves of the Commission and in the offices of well-meaning people and governments .
We must show leadership as must the media , educational institutions and the churches ; they have not shown such leadership in the past .
Shame on us for ignoring Mozambique for so long and doing too little , too late .
It is a real shame on us and the other European institutions that we cannot respond to these kinds of disasters .
Shame on us for allowing the children of Iraq to die at the rate of 5 000 a month .
Half a million have died since the introduction of sanctions .
There continues to be a barbarous war in Iraq .
Bombing continues ruthlessly and unreported .
It is a war against children and the innocent citizens of that country .
We should intervene with the Security Council individually and collectively to ensure that medicines are delivered to the people .
Shame on us for allowing the sale of arms and weapons to the Great Lakes region .
Shame on us in the European Union for not stamping out racism and xenophobia which are endemic in my country and in the EU in general .
Racism is a crime - a crime that is not pursued in the Union , an offence against a law that is not enforced in the Union .
It is something we have a great responsibility to do something about .
We are not doing anything whatsoever about it .
The citizens of this Union are our judges and juries .
Unless we show them leadership and a sense of purpose , a sense of direction , they will make their judgements in the coming years .
We will have failed them unless we tackle racism and xenophobia in the European Union .
I want to say to my government that we must do the same at home in Ireland .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Belder on his sound report which deals with the fight against racism , xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate countries .
This all revolves around the kind of philosophy on man and society people take their inspiration from , and Mr Belder has presented his in no uncertain terms .
The report is based on the notion of the unity of the human species , a Christian teaching which forms a firm barrier against any lapses of a racist nature .
Man could be seen as being created in the image of God .
This should make it impossible to see one ' s fellow man as a threat or to harm his dignity .
Mr Belder quite clearly does not pursue the ideology , which is termed conservative by some , which defends the identity of communities against cultural influences from outside .
An ideology of this kind , which overestimates the sense of community , contains insufficient guarantees against tendencies towards discrimination .
I condemn such a conservative ideology .
The candidate Member States expect the European Union to be a constitutional community based on the common acceptance of values which are mostly of a Jewish-Christian origin .
It is only logical that we should observe these values .
This does not always accord with their and our gut reactions but that is - like it or not - the trademark of sound principles .
They do not always turn out to be to our advantage .
People have to overcome their fears and short-term interests .
We need to help the candidate Member States in a critical , yet constructive , way and not be afraid to call a spade a spade .
The Belder report contains a few concrete pointers in this respect .
Churches , trade unions , women ' s organisations , occupational training courses and other educational institutions , in particular , play a decisive role in this .
My Group did not have any reason to table any more amendments .
With regard to Mrs Ludford ' s report , I belong to a minority in my Group who do not consider the report ' s shortcomings serious enough to vote against it .
It is true that proposals on voting rights for foreigners do not fit in at all in a report on xenophobia , but we do agree on the principle of drafting a recommendation in this respect .
I have subscribed to this practice in the Netherlands for some 25 years , starting with the South Moluccans .
I have no problem at all with providing them with government jobs .
Governments do well to give ethnic minorities a visible presence in police forces , for example .
In my opinion , it is extremely impractical to restrict the options in this respect , and I certainly do not want to see this become a requirement .
What interest would be served in doing so ?
If the Ludford report is not changed for the worse by amendments , the minority which I represent here will vote for this report .
Mr President , I have two brief comments to make to the previous speaker , my esteemed colleague Mr Oostlander .
As far as the debate on the Ludford and Haarder reports is concerned , allow me to make a few technical observations on behalf of my Group .
Mr Haarder submitted an excellent draft report to the committee and the committee tabled 170 proposed amendments and 22 compromise amendments , making a total of 192 amendments .
The committee spent days discussing them and then voted on a largely amended report and now we have another 69 proposed amendments here in plenary .
There is nothing dramatic about this per se , but nearly half the proposed amendments are from the group which calls itself TDI : the Technical Group of Independent Members .
This is the combination of Mrs Bonino and Mr Le Pen , in itself a sensational combination , but this club never takes part in debates on technical work .
These ladies and gentlemen are never present in committee .
They never take part in detailed discussions of the problems .
Why then do we always have these proposed amendments in plenary ?
The answer is in their speeches , which we have already had the pleasure of here today .
They want to use this forum to bring their platitudes to the attention of as wide an audience as possible throughout the world .
Technical work , no thank you .
Simplified rabble-rousing , yes please .
That is the political strategy of the extreme right in this House .
This is important , because only those who are critical of themselves have the right to criticise others .
That is why these reports , both Baroness Ludford ' s antiracism report and Mr Haarder ' s human rights report , pave the way .
The annual debate on these matters paves the way for the basic political orientation of the European Union .
And when I learn that these reports are being abused for prosaic domestic policy considerations , then those who practise this abuse are ill-advised .
I just wonder what that has to do with human rights .
Anyone who abuses a human rights report in order to make national domestic policy has missed the point completely .
As far as the fuss in points 41 and 42 about Savoyard princes being allowed to enter Italy is concerned , I fail to see exactly how human rights are being violated .
Anyone who wants to hold a serious discussion on human rights in the EU should talk about human rights and not abuse these valuable and excellent reports for tactical domestic policy games .
( Applause )
Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , after this debate , it should be crystal clear that the issue of human rights is not just something to talk about on Sundays while wearing your Sunday best .
Human rights must be integrated into all political cooperation that the EU is involved in .
We need consistency , patience and a well thought-out strategy for turning noble words into concrete action that leads to results .
I hope that the message has got through and that , in this House , we will soon receive specific proposals from the Council on how we can take this work forward together .
Mr President , although we are moving in the right direction , not everything in the garden is rosy .
For example , some States do not respect the basic right to education and the use of one ' s own language .
How can we justify our habit of talking about human rights in places thousands of kilometres away while at home we do the opposite and vary our positions according to commercial and political interests ?
Chirac speaks of the rights of the Inuits in Quebec , but ignores linguistic rights in France .
He condemns Jospin for calling Hezbollah by its name while he pontificates about other types of organisations and prides himself on his anti-terrorist cooperation with Spain .
The Spanish Prime Minister speaks of Chechnya as if it were an internal affair , thereby clearly allying himself with the extermination of the Chechen people .
This approach to politics , based on pure hypocrisy , is entirely unacceptable to us .
Finally , for the Basque citizens whom I represent , there can be no excuses based on internal affairs or on political opportunism .
For us there are simply , here and elsewhere , people , citizens , with unalienable rights on which we wish to base our coexistence .
The Italian Constitution solemnly bans the former kings of the House of Savoy , their consorts and male descendants from entering or residing on Italian territory .
The Italian Constitution is the result of the great historical agreement between all the democratic forces which fought against fascism and to liberate Italy during the Second World War .
It is intolerable that the European Parliament should ask us to breach the provisions of this Constitution , which is one of the most democratic and advanced Constitutions in the world .
Moreover , the House of Savoy has never acknowledged the sovereignty of the Republic or the irrevocable nature of the decision to create a Republic , which is enshrined in the Constitution .
Mr President , we have no hesitation or uncertainty in rejecting the request , which is unexpected in this context , to breach the Italian Constitution .
We have no hesitation in reiterating that there is no room in my country for the descendants of the former kings of Italy .
I have identified three particularly characteristic points .
We are invited to achieve a more ethnically diverse workforce which will require , in the first instance , all staff to be identified by ethnic origin .
We will have to establish controlled records or , in other words , conduct a policy of racial discrimination of the masochistic type known as positive discrimination .
We are also invited to recognise all the new religious communities and to afford them the same rights and the same existence as the religions of the Bible .
This unfortunately echoes a decision taken yesterday by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg which gives the Church of Scientology the satisfaction of being treated like all European religions .
Finally , it is suggested that we give homosexual couples the same rights as families .
You are forgetting that families obtain their rights from the State and from the nations clearly because they allow the State and the nations to continue in existence and because they have a common interest .
Yet I must say that all this supposedly antiracist talk has some common features , the first of which is intellectual invalidity and the second the destruction of liberty .
This talk is intellectually invalid because the terms used are not even defined .
What are racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extremism ?
What do these concepts cover ?
What are their philosophical origins ?
What doctrines do they involve ?
Do those accused of these acts deserve this opprobrium ?
The aim is really to fraudulently make patriotic sentiment seem to be expansionist nationalism , the legitimate refusal of migration policy to be xenophobia and the desire of nations to preserve their identity to be racism .
This is completely absurd .
Racism is the desire to achieve the domination of one race over another .
Who is racist in Europe nowadays ?
Xenophobia is the rejection of a foreign presence .
You can morally condemn this but , politically speaking , you should consider that , in its literal meaning , xenophobia is the source of all the national liberation movements which we have praised at other times .
As for antisemitism which is apparently re-emerging in Europe , why not ask the real questions ?
Yet the problem with this supposed antiracism is not its search for truth or even its support for migrants ...
Mr Schulz , my family never accepted any German capo . This will not start with you ! ...
It is rather a question of nipping in the bud any vague desires which nations might have to oppose the destruction of their identity .
The religion of antiracism has its dogmas , its priests , its inquisitors and its witch-hunts .
History will roundly condemn the protagonists of this shameful ideology which we are proud to fight at any time .
The English philosopher John Locke once said that a country without law is a country without freedom .
For instance , Victor Emmanuel of Italy was forced to leave his native Italy as an uncomprehending nine-year old child , and for fifty-three years has been unable to return .
If he sails from his home in Corsica in the direction of Italian territorial waters , coastguards are mobilised using modern satellite technology instructing him with loudspeakers to turn back .
His twenty-eight-year-old son has only been to Italy once when his plane was diverted to Milan airport because of bad weather .
The plane was surrounded by police guards and he was told not to step off the plane .
Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State .
There is much talk of a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Such talk will ring exceedingly hollow if this Parliament does not first do all it can to address existing Treaty violations .
This is also the case for Austria where Otto von Habsburg was required to deny his own identity and renounce rights belonging to him and to members of his family to enter Austria .
The rights under the Treaty are not conditional in my view .
The Treaty does not discriminate against individual families and the Treaty is therefore violated .
The right to enter , live and die in your own country are fundamental , sacrosanct rights and I hope that this Parliament will uphold them .
I therefore commend paragraphs 41 and 42 to this House .
Mr President , respect for human rights is one of the European Union ' s cornerstones .
That is what it says in the Treaties and that is what we keep reminding each other of .
It is therefore to be welcomed that every year , the European Parliament issues a report on respecting human rights within the European Union itself .
The commotion is justified , given the nature of the topic , but the confusion is not .
Fortunately , we can show our disagreement by drumming our fingers on our tables .
Thanks to our discussions , I have gained a much deeper insight into the complexity of the matter and I would especially praise him here in public for his openness .
As far as the content of the report is concerned , I would like to outline a few topics .
Is it not rather ironic that it is precisely asylum and migration issues , which are at the very top of the political agenda in Europe , that have been echoed so clearly in this report ?
Should , in fact , the European policy on asylum and migration not lead to fewer human rights violations in this field ?
To ask the question is to answer it .
It is wise to remain vigilant when it comes to observing human rights of the extensive minorities in Europe .
People from these groups , more often than not economically vulnerable , run the considerable risk of becoming victims of discrimination .
The reality is that millions of people live in poverty in our rich and privileged Europe .
The report quite rightly describes this issue of poverty and disadvantage in terms of human rights , and this seems to be a step in the right direction .
The report also devotes attention to the issue of the equal treatment of men and women and the equal treatment of different types of relation and life styles , more so than in previous years .
Free choices which people make in their private lives , and which do not harm anybody , should be honoured , with respect for diversity and with a guarantee of the principle of equal treatment .
As is evident from the amendments , the battle is not over yet , not by a long shot .
My Group , on the other hand , considers the principle of equality sacrosanct .
After all , human rights are there for everybody .
Mr President , I should like to express my thanks for the broad support given to the main features of this report .
Human rights are , of course , indivisible and independent of political parties and national borders .
It is therefore important that we in this Parliament should obtain broad agreement on this issue , for a right cannot , of course , be universal if half of Parliament is opposed to it .
I should especially like to thank Mrs Swiebel , both for her friendly words today and for the intense collaboration which we have had and which has naturally given her considerable influence .
I should like to tell her that I am also delighted to vote for the further amendments which she has tabled and which we shall be voting on tomorrow .
I should also , however , like to thank Mr Pirker and Mrs Palacio .
I should like to express my gratitude for the broad agreement we have obtained in connection with this report .
I think this is commendable , especially this year when human rights have been so high on the agenda of the European Union .
Finally , I would say to Mr Krarup that he must withdraw his expression of delight at the change in paragraph 61 , because this was an error pure and simple .
There are ten words missing from the Danish version .
If he reads the English version , he will be able to see what the wording should be .
Mr President , in the present report China has been subjected to criticism .
The reports direct criticism towards twenty or so countries outside Europe and towards almost all EU and candidate countries .
In fact , I am considering sending the reports to the EU committee of the National People 's Congress in Beijing and suggesting that they do something similar .
How about a self-critical report from the National People 's Congress on human rights in China and a report on human rights in the world and in the EU , as seen from a Chinese point of view ?
In actual fact , of course , we do need to discuss human rights with China . Then the Chinese will have to discuss and not just protest .
At the same time , the European Union turns a blind eye to situations in which human rights are being savagely violated when , of course , it comes to protecting its imperialistic interests .
Its attitude towards the Turkish regime is a blatant example .
Furthermore , the policy being exercised by the European Union at home basically violates a series of fundamental human rights .
Political and social rights are being hit and individual rights and democratic freedoms are being trampled underfoot .
The results of this policy are already visible in the support being given to extremist , racist , Fascist powers , and not just in Austria .
And yet the report on the fight against racism does not demonstrate that the necessary conclusions have been drawn .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Haarder whose excellent work I would describe as well-balanced , measured and well thought out .
Furthermore , since I have had the honour of working with him on previous annual reports on human rights , I know how difficult it is .
I hope that he receives the broad support of this House that he has asked for .
He deserves it .
Mr President , at the beginning of his first intervention , Mr Haarder said that Europe did not invent human rights , and that is true .
We have talked about the defence of these human rights and I would now like to insist that if we proclaim human rights , it naturally follows that we must ensure that those rights can be exercised .
Just one more example : last Sunday the Basque people received an intimidating invitation not to turn out to vote .
Fortunately , Basque society voted en masse , displaying the courage which is so essential in that environment .
Mr President , I want to speak for a few moments on the Ludford report on countering racism in the European Union .
This is a very important topic .
It is crucial for the construction of a peaceful and harmonious Europe , a Europe united in its objective and at ease with itself and its citizens .
That is certainly what we , on this side of the House , believe .
That is what this report aims to do .
But the EPP it seems , and others opposite , clearly do not want that .
We heard a few moments ago a disgraceful speech from Mr Gollnisch on behalf of his party .
Mrs Palacio , who is just leaving , has said that human rights are needed in a public place and at the core .
And yet , by their amendments to the Ludford report , they seek to divide Europe and to make millions of our brothers and sisters from the ethnic minorities second-class citizens .
The EPP 's amendments seek to divide families .
They object to family unity .
Their Amendment No 12 seeks to delete reference to the need for family unity in Europe .
The EPP , it seems , do not accept that ethnic minorities feel alienated from the electoral process .
They do not feel that the European Parliament and national parliaments should reflect Europe 's diverse ethnic nature .
That is the aim of Amendment No 13 . It deletes that from the report .
They are against ethnic diversity and they do not accept the benefits given to our society by all its people .
They do not accept that everyone has a part to play in the electoral process .
We cannot complain about what is going on in the candidate states if we have amendments like this being put forward in the European Union .
Nor , it seems , does the EPP believe that ethnic minorities should be encouraged to vote .
Is that what we want ?
I do not think it is .
We , on this side of the House , reject that position completely .
We will publicise the EPP position and their amendments whether they are passed or not .
We deplore the line that Mr Hernandez Mollar and his colleague have put forward .
We urge the Liberal Group to dissociate themselves from their links with the EPP over the amendments because it has shown itself to have racist instincts in its party .
Should the EPP amendments to this report be adopted we will oppose the whole report .
The EPP amendments weaken the report and would make the position of this Parliament worse than at the moment .
It would make it so weak that it would be one that we could not support .
It would be a retrograde step .
So , I urge all colleagues to reject the amendments put forward by the European People 's Party and their colleagues on the far right .
Mr President , I thank all those who have spoken on my report .
I should just like to clear up a few misunderstandings .
Firstly , nowhere does this report say that fighting racism means you should have no immigration controls .
It says that such controls should not be racially discriminatory and should avoid fuelling xenophobic attitudes or hostility to ethnic minorities .
The references to enhanced rights for third country nationals means , of course , rights for those who are legally resident .
Secondly , on religion and identity , there is an assertion that there is no exclusivity .
I agree with Mr Schulz .
Christianity has been an important contributor to European values but it does not hold a monopoly on them .
Thirdly , reference has been made to quotas .
Nowhere in this report are quotas mentioned .
As a liberal I am opposed to quotas .
Fourthly , on Austria , the assertion is made that we should not mention Austria because of the time-frame of the report .
This report is the annual debate on racism in the year 2000 .
It refers to where we are now .
I welcome the remarks of Mr Oostlander , and I welcome his support for the report .
As a gesture of goodwill I will be accepting five small amendments from the EPP , though incidentally none of those mentioned by Mr Evans .
I very much hope that more members of the EPP / ED Group will support this report .
Mr President , what has not been stressed sufficiently thus far in the debate I believe is democracy and subsidiarity .
Article 3b of the Maastricht Treaty , President , still confines subsidiarity to the relationship between the European Union and the Member States .
Regions and stateless nations are ignored .
People within their own communities therefore suffer .
They are unable to establish the structures they need so that human rights can prosper and the blight of racism can be forever removed .
In own nation , Wales , for example , we have no empowerment to establish our own laws to counter racism and defend human rights .
The principles of cohesion and the drive to limit poverty and depravity in our communities are a well-settled concept in the European Union .
However , it must encompass respect for minorities everywhere if it to inspire the world in its drive towards defeating racism and defending human rights .
A heartfelt thank you to the rapporteurs for their work .
More and more , we need to follow our words with actions .
Disrespect for human rights , racism , xenophobia and antisemitism are not confined to other continents , but are also present here , within ourselves , our lives and our institutions .
Even in this Parliament , fascist and xenophobic opinions are expressed .
We must start with ourselves if we want to build a world where everyone helps each other .
Europe is full of Haiders .
We are Haiders when , in Rome , parties of the right-wing opposition and the new centre incite the people to hatred and prevent the authorities from accommodating the Roma safely in places with running water and electricity .
And this does not mean that I do not condemn the unlawful behaviour of many Roma and other immigrants .
I would like to be able to share with everyone my conviction that , in our countries , no one is a stranger .
For this reason I give my full support to the proposals contained in the resolutions which promote and lend support to all those elements which contribute to a culture of peaceful coexistence and all-embracing citizenship .
Mr President , I should like to concentrate mainly on certain aspects of the Belder report , which contains an excellent analysis of the current situation in the candidate countries .
As far as these candidates are concerned , and this has already been said , we must avoid creating the impression that we demand higher standards of them than we meet ourselves .
We should compare the actual situation in these countries with the reality in our own countries rather than with our perfect legal texts , otherwise the candidate countries will always come off worse in practice .
We should not look down from our high moral horse and condemn this phenomenon as long as it is only a question of temporary manifestations on the path towards self-definition .
I should like to use the situation in Estonia and Latvia as an example of a positive development between two sections of the population which is by no means self-evident .
The fact that the Russian tanks which withdrew in 1994 were often daubed with the words " We ' ll be back ! " did little to foster understanding between the Baltic states and Russia .
And yet , despite this history , there has not been one single incident of violent clashes between the majority and minority sections of the population since they regained independence .
I therefore take the view that the express call to continue measures to integrate the Russian minority contained in point 14 of the Belder report is unnecessary .
This is already happening .
This express reference creates the erroneous impression that this is not the case .
The new multicultural Europe needs a policy which ensures that immigrants and different social groups and minorities are integrated into the social , political and economic life of national societies .
What we need is a common European asylum and immigration policy based on European humanitarian values .
Of course , the education sector is also important and we need huge improvements in education for the children of immigrants and gypsies .
At the same time , the mass media need to help fight prejudices and to demonstrate the beauty of modern multicoloured , multicultural society .
Of course , within this framework , respect for those who are conscientious objectors , for example , and who do not therefore wish to serve in the army , should be guaranteed .
I should like to take this opportunity of assuring the European Parliament that the problem which used to exist in Greece no longer exists , following the adoption and application of legislation on 1.1.98 .
The reference in question , therefore , in Mr Haarder ' s otherwise excellent report , is therefore irrelevant today .
The abolition of the death penalty worldwide is the very least that we should be calling for if we really want to defend human rights .
The condemned sometimes await their execution for many years in American prisons .
Having respectively suffered 26 and 18 years of this vile torture of waiting on death row , they must immediately be set free .
As it is now time for the votes , we shall suspend the joint debate and it shall resume at 3 p.m.
Vote
Madam President , to clarify the situation , 29 amendments have been tabled together with a proposal to reject the common position .
As rapporteur , I obviously support the amendments of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
I also support all the amendments intended to restore the position adopted by the European Parliament at first reading .
On the other hand , as rapporteur , I must clearly state that I cannot support the amendments which deviate too far from the position adopted at first reading .
This concerns Amendments Nos 17 , 16 and 19 in particular . Clearly , I also cannot support the proposal for rejection tabled by the Union for a Europe of Nations Group under Amendment No 8 .
Thank you , Mr Lannoye . This is totally clear .
After the vote :
Madam President , can the Commission confirm that it has accepted Amendment No 1 by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy ?
This would mean that the directive could be adopted by a qualified majority , and we would then be able to lay the directive to rest .
Belgians and French people would then be able to enjoy British chocolate as much as the British have enjoyed French and Belgian chocolate .
( The President declared the common position approved ( as amended ) )

( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Madam President , I would like to point out a mistake in translation in Amendments Nos 18 and 30 .
Quite right , Mrs Myller . I am informed that the Translation Department is already aware of these errors .
We can therefore point these out at the appropriate moment .
Before the vote on Amendment No 18
In both Amendment No 18 and No 30 it should read " critical loads should not be exceeded " .
In place of the word ' exceeded ' it says ' reached ' , which is the opposite .
Thank you . Everyone is now clear on this .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the Special European Council to be held in Lisbon on 23 / 24 March 2000
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Madam President , I would be most grateful if we could lay Mrs Caroline Jackson ' s resolution to rest in the Committee on the Environment ; we could take care of it in three or four minutes .
I would be most grateful if we do that right now .
I feel that we should not spend any more time on this .
I will therefore put this to the House .
Madam President , please note that the French socialists in the House will not take part in the vote as we consider that the tabled motion is not impartial .
We also consider that the application of directives is the responsibility of the law , the Commission and the Court of Justice .
We do not therefore wish to take part in this vote which we regard as partisan .
We do not in fact yet know whether we will be voting on this motion this morning as I was going to put this to the House .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must think about this carefully .
I did say clearly , at the start of voting time , that we would go as far as the motion for a resolution on the European Council in Lisbon .
I said that we would end at 1.15 p.m. and we have respected this timetable .
We should keep to what was decided .
Madam President , I disagree with this decision .
The House is free to decide if it wishes to vote on this now or not and I would therefore request that we take a vote on whether to vote .
( The President put the proposal to the House which decided to end voting time )
Madam President , I did not want to interrupt the voting when I arrived a little bit late .
Could we request that the bells be rung a little bit earlier ?
The lift was full of Vice-Presidents , Quaestors and all sorts of people coming down from the twelfth floor .
Absolutely , Mrs Banotti .
We will make a note of this .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Recommendation for second reading of the Lannoye report ( A5-0047 / 2000 )
However , these amendments were not adopted , unfortunately .
As a consequence , we remain concerned about the third-world cocoa producers .
We predict that , despite any improvements for the benefit of producers of other vegetable fats , the overall outcome will , in any case , be harmful to the third world .
It is regrettable that the study into the impact of the new directive for the countries in the South was not carried out earlier .
From now on , chocolate is no longer a product which consists of nothing but cocoa butter .
In some parts of the Union , the name ' chocolate ' was already used , even if the product contained substitute products .
We regret that the standardisation we have achieved is to the detriment of the consumer and the cocoa producer , and was dictated by the pursuit of profit .
This states that chocolate is the former name for an authentic , healthy and quality product , produced in its day according to ancestral tradition and to which some delightfully outdated nostalgia-seekers are still attached .
Once again it seems that the law of business or , in other words , the law of the strongest has been preferred over the protection of consumers , SMEs and our craftsmen ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , given the disastrous vote just now on the chocolate issue , I must say that I am not particularly proud of what we have approved .
The European Parliament is clearly not in tune with public opinion in several respects .
Firstly , its position does not correspond to the demands of consumers who want clear labelling .
We have not granted them this labelling on chocolate .
Parliament is also not in tune with public opinion which is becoming increasingly reticent about GMOs .
We have rightly refused to allow GMOs in chocolate , but only by three votes .
In addition , we have applied the precautionary principle by refusing the prior studies on the impact which this directive will have on the producing countries and so on .
Nothing has changed .
The question to be asked is who really benefits from the manipulation and ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
The victors are not just British chocolate makers but chocolate consumers right across Europe who will now be free to wallow in the delight of Dairy Milk , Galaxy and Milky Way at will .
Clear labelling will enable consumers to choose and enjoy the chocolate that they want .
Their taste buds will no longer be deprived by Europe 's chocolate police .
Developing countries are also the victors .
This legislation takes account of the needs of the world 's poorest farmers .
Those vegetable fats permitted will be of tropical origin , and there will also be a review of the impact of the directive after three years .
Best of all , the directive will increase chocolate sales overall , thereby increasing the market for developing countries ' exports .
So chocoholics can now munch safe in the knowledge they are doing their bit for the Third World .
I am sure you will agree that the EU , in the past , has got itself into a right Twix on this matter .
Some governments have got their Snickers in a twist trying to protect their chocolate industries .
For them , however , Crunchie time has come and they now have Creme Egg on their faces .
It is high time the European Parliament gave two Cadbury 's Fingers to the chocolate snobs .
- It is now sixteen years since the debate on chocolate started in the European Parliament .
I believe that we should not even have become involved in this directive .
Debates about national tastes and products give us too far wide a sphere for ridiculous discussions .
Consumer choice will be exercised regardless of what the EU does , and that is only fair .
National chauvinism has been all too often evident in the chocolate debate .
Given that the resultant product incorrectly referred to as chocolate will not be any cheaper , consumers will not gain in the purchase price what they will lose in transparency with regard to the nature of the product .
Although we do not share the protectionist concerns hiding behind the defence of ' real chocolate ' , we do not see any reason to vote for the Commission directive .
After more than two years of prevarication , the Council finally adopted in October 1999 a common position on the directive relating to cocoa and chocolate products .
As it stands , this text does not allow the interests of consumers , small-scale chocolate makers or cocoa producers to be protected . It also does not guarantee the quality of chocolate .
This proposal in no way responds to the concerns expressed by MEPs during the vote at first reading on 23 October 1998 .
This text opens the door to the industrial production of cocoa butter equivalents based on palm oil , the price of which is significantly lower than that of cocoa .
Its adoption could lead to a dramatic fall in income for the eleven million people earning a living from cocoa in West Africa and for all the producing regions .
However , there is no guarantee that the chocolate industry will use shea nut oil which , in any case , can only replace 50 % of the cocoa butter .
This is a largely artificial conflict between cocoa producers and shea producers , between poor countries and even poorer countries .
In reality , this proposed directive mainly reflects the position of the chocolate multinationals and defends only their interests with any certainty .
I am therefore not happy about this .
This is why I fully support the amendments which place greater importance on the concerns of small-scale chocolate makers , the interests of consumers and the future of millions of small-scale cocoa producers .
Firstly I must congratulate the rapporteur on his tenacity in this ' chocolate ' issue .
Next I will sketch the broad outlines of this issue .
The eight other Member States - Germany , Belgium , Spain , France , Greece , Italy , Luxembourg and the Netherlands - ban vegetable fats .
This has clearly succeeded in causing some occasionally stormy debates and has particularly revived legitimate concerns among consumers .
A campaign has subsequently developed to promote food quality at the same time as food diversity .
The replacement of cocoa butter with other vegetable fats raises a question about protecting the very nature of chocolate .
Adequate guarantees must therefore be provided for both consumers and cocoa producers .
We must demand the following :
very explicit wording intended for consumers so that they can buy chocolate in full knowledge of the facts ;
the reservation of the name ' quality chocolate ' for products which contain cocoa butter ;
the restriction of alternative vegetable fats to tropical fats not obtained using enzymatic production processes and not originating from genetic engineering ;
a study into the impact of such a measure on the export of cocoa by developing countries .
I support these demands which are contained in the amendments tabled by the rapporteur . I myself am a consumer who is concerned about the quality and taste of traditional chocolate .
I also believe that consumer protection policy , elevated to the rank of a Community policy , does not just involve food safety and the protection of health .
It must aim to promote quality food which is part of a more general philosophy of quality of life !
The directive also provides for the marketing of these chocolate products containing vegetable fats in all Member States , subject to a label which lists the ingredients .
This is a position of principle which is not really open to negotiation , just like the protection of quality products and consumers which we all are .
This is all cock-eyed .
What is even more astonishing is that this same Europe produces mad cows , sheep with scrapie and chickens containing dioxin and imports hormone-treated beef and genetically modified cereals .
Of course we should ' inform ' consumers that the products they are buying are adulterated .
Yet this is nonsensical when this information is written in small letters in an incomprehensible language on the back of the packaging .
You are accustomed to doing anything you like in the name of your dogmas , free movement , free competition and free trade .
Please stop messing about with our gastronomic traditions , our quality products and our soil .
Stop playing with our food .
Now that would be real progress .
Understand this . I and my colleagues on the European right will vote for the ' zero option ' which is no vegetable fats other than cocoa butter in chocolate .
Who would have believed it ?
In terms of chocolate , as in other areas , different cultures and traditions exist .
Everyone has different tastes .
In addition to the ' product quality and taste ' aspect there is , of course , the ' development policy ' aspect .
The situation being as it is , I would have preferred the common position to be rejected in the same way that I prefer good handmade chocolate to an industrial product which is currently unverifiable .
Unfortunately , a small majority in this House has failed to ensure that consumers can enjoy real chocolate .
. ( PT ) We fundamentally reject the principle of allowing chocolate to be produced throughout the Member States using a percentage of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter .
This is for reasons connected with safeguarding the legitimate interests of cocoa-producing countries and also reasons relating to consumer protection .
It is quite clear that a step of this kind would inevitably have an adverse effect on cocoa-producing countries .
Furthermore , and this is the key reason for our views , consideration has not even been given to a study on the impact of such a measure on developing countries that produce cocoa .
This directive alters the very definition of chocolate which should , in our opinion , be made from cocoa butter and beans .
We do not have the right to mislead the consumer by using the name ' chocolate ' to designate products which are not necessarily made from cocoa .
Consumers require clear and specific information .
They should no longer be deceived .
Today ' s vote went beyond the problem of chocolate alone and has threatened the confidence of our fellow citizens .
This is why I voted for all the amendments which aimed to improve this directive and which were tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
- ( DA ) The basis for prosperity in the EU is competition .
And the intention in adopting a new directive on chocolate products is precisely to improve competition in the EU .
With regard to food policy and consumer protection , we must be very careful .
But this is not a question of health or environmental protection .
Seen from the consumers ' point of view , it is exclusively a question of taste .
It cannot therefore be right for politicians to decide what consumers should be entitled to choose between .
Products should be put on sale , and it should be clear what they contain , but otherwise we must rely upon consumers ' own judgement .
We can hardly do otherwise .
Consumers should find out for themselves what tastes best .
If , today , we are obliged to note considerable opposition to the proposal here in Parliament , this cannot be viewed as anything other than an attempt on the part of certain chocolate manufacturers to curb competition .
If one looks at where the opposition is coming from , it is also clear that it crosses the Group divide and comes mainly from those countries which are already using current rules to protect their chocolate industries .
Where a clear and unambiguous labelling obligation would have been sufficient to allow the marketing of all the types of chocolate available in Europe , one of those grotesque compromises at which we are so adept has been proposed .
Although the construction of the internal market is a way to strengthen Europe in the face of world competition , this must not lead to a totalitarian dogma and meddling at all levels of our home life .
In particular , the diversity of Europe ' s gastronomy and food customs is part of its heritage and culture , if only at the cost of local specialities foreign to the internal market .
The people of Europe do not want this to be a place with standardised consumers living in a large uniform internal market .
They expect major political ambition from Europe , not punctilious regulations of secondary importance .
The misadventures of the new ' chocolate directive ' primarily illustrate the extraordinary weight and slowness of the Community ' s legislative process .
Has such a long process at least resulted in a practical text ?
The answer is clearly no .
The new directive does not meet any of the relevant needs .
The 1973 directive clearly and unambiguously defined chocolate as a product made with sugar and cocoa .
To take account of the food customs of certain northern countries , derogations were specified .
The situation was therefore satisfactory .
So why change it ?
Why , under the pretext of ' simplification ' , has it actually been attempted to subvert the 1973 directive ?
Might the rest of the acquis communautaire no longer be untouchable ?
A site located in France , for example , cannot produce chocolate which does not meet the French standards . These stipulate that chocolate cannot contain vegetable fats other than cocoa butter .
However , these multinationals particularly want to minimise the cost of their raw materials and do not care that this will be at the cost of a change in the composition of chocolate .
Cocoa butter represents 8 to 9 % of the total price of chocolate .
Shea butter costs a third of the price of cocoa butter and palm oil butter is ten times cheaper .
By adopting a list of alternatives to cocoa butter and by specifying a percentage , this new directive is opening the door to further changes and this is the heart of the matter .
Tomorrow , the percentage will simply have to be increased and then soya , for example , could be added to the vegetable fats proposed today .
Will this at least increase the level of requirements and quality for all Member States ?
Not at all .
In fact , quite the contrary .
As usual , harmonisation is occurring at the lowest common denominator .
It is the lowest quality level which will be generalised in order to ultimately impose a standardised Euro-taste , to the detriment of taste quality .
Will the new text at least allow the consumer to easily distinguish between true and imitation chocolate ?
The Commission is therefore setting a percentage which it knows is unverifiable .
This is deceitful .
The text also contains dishonest provisions in terms of labelling .
As this amendment was not retained by the Council , the consumer will not be correctly informed .
In all countries and for all consumers with a taste for real chocolate , the name ' chocolate ' can now legally cover a completely different product .
Chocolate lovers , religiously savour your next Easter eggs !
This will be the last time you can be sure that they have been made with real pre-harmonisation chocolate .
What will be next after chocolate ?
When labelling comes in the door , sense flies out the window ...
This is a distinctive label used throughout Europe which we want to imbue with renewed vigour .
Like the French NF Environnement mark , this label is voluntary which means that it is up to manufacturers to apply for it .
It is based on the principle of a global approach which takes account of the whole life cycle of the product .
However , we must not cast aside all the national logos .
Consumers and buyers have their own codes and have built up their confidence on the logos which they know .
Any attempt to replace the national logos would end up once again confusing the people of Europe who are lost among a forest of markings including lists of ingredients , quality labels , logos and references to regions .
You could almost imagine yourself faced with a bar of chocolate !
As our main goal is to help SMEs gain access to these essential Community eco-labels , we support the rapporteur .
- Madam President , I wholeheartedly support Europe 's moves to become an eco-friendly continent .
This measure is yet further proof of the EU 's commitment to greening up its act .
Since 1992 , the Euro-Flower logo has become a hallmark of environmentally-friendly products , ranging from washing machines to writing paper .
However , consumers ' enthusiasm for green goods has yet to be matched by industry .
The measures contained in this 3-year strategy , however , should hopefully bring manufacturers on board .
In the fight to clean up our planet , Britain 's Labour Government has , of course , been at the forefront .
At Kyoto , for example , Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott secured , against the odds , an agreement to cut global emissions .
Britain is already well on the way to achieving its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % by 2010 .
Not content with that , the Government has recently raised the target to 60-70 % by 2050 .
This House should challenge other Member States to match Britain 's example .
They will get their chance to pick up the gauntlet at the forthcoming Kyoto follow-up Conference in The Hague this November .
Of course , protecting the planet means much more than just cleaning up the atmosphere .
It means protecting the natural environment on the ground too .
Again , Britain 's Labour Government is leading the way .
Its recent Wildlife Bill , for example , will give greater protection to endangered species than ever before .
Furthermore , ' right to roam ' legislation will give the British public the freedom to enjoy and appreciate our beautiful countryside .
Madam President , coherent action is urgently required at local , national and European levels to clean up our land , sea and air .
The Euro-Flower is just one element of the broader environmental strategy that is needed to save our planet .
Our citizens want to see concrete action .
They do not want to see mere hot air from politicians , which just adds to global warming .
By harnessing Euro-Flower power , we can all contribute to a cleaner , greener world .
Recommendation for second reading of the Blokland report ( A5-0056 / 2000 )
- Blokland rightly raises serious concerns regarding waste disposal , including incineration .
Coming from a country with over 90 % landfill use , I face the conclusion that properly controlled incineration is both necessary and inevitable .
Commitment by the Irish Government to serious recycling and separation of waste is far from evident .
Separation of waste , including use of organic waste for composting , must be a priority in any waste strategy .
Waste management is a very complex issue subject to extensive lobbying .
This is why the European Union has adopted a comprehensive strategy to tackle this major environmental and health challenge .
The directive before us today is part of this strategy as it aims to regulate the thermal treatment of hazardous or non-hazardous waste .
I myself have always been doubtful about the incineration of hazardous waste being dealt with in the same legislation as the incineration of non-hazardous waste .
I therefore raised my concerns and questions at first reading .
Regrettably , in my opinion , a majority has approved co-incineration .
This is why I am now fighting for measures to be adopted in order to guarantee that emission standards for hazardous waste will not be diluted .
Everyone knows that the volume of waste to be incinerated in the European Union is set to increase .
Thirty-one million tonnes of municipal waste were incinerated in 1990 and this figure will be in excess of 56 million this year .
There are several reasons for this , including the increase in the volume of waste produced and the fall in the quantity of waste sent to landfills .
It is well known that the incineration of waste causes emissions of substances which seriously pollute the air , soil and water and which are therefore dangerous to health .
The pollutants emitted depend both on the nature of the waste to be treated and the technologies used to treat this waste .
This is why our concerns focus on the emissions of heavy metals , dioxins and furanes .
The debate has particularly crystallised around co-incineration plants .
These use hazardous waste as fuel for the production of energy or physical elements .
Although the provisions of the applicable directives impose a maximum limit of 40 % of hazardous waste in the fuel used , this percentage is too high !
These plants must be subject to very strict control standards , at least as strict as those imposed on incinerators .
In addition , the generalised use of this hazardous waste must not lead to the production of this waste becoming acceptable .
We are at great risk of being told in the future that , as investments have been made to build these co-incinerators , we must now make these profitable !
I firmly reject these arguments in advance as they will lead to an increase in the volume of hazardous waste being transported with all the risks which this entails for the environment and safety .
- The European Union has been at the forefront in devising new waste management strategies in recent years .
This directive also seeks to control the discharge of waste into our water systems .
This report is now before us at second reading .
I believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal .
It is very important that the European Union is very active in putting in place new waste management proposals .
Waste in Europe has been generated at a rate of over 1kg per person per day . 2 billion tonnes of waste are being generated within the EU each year .
There is a growing concern about the environmental consequences of landfill sites in general .
Nothing less than a major shift from reliance on landfill sites to more integrated waste management plans will suffice .
The European Union fully supports the strict , ambitious but attainable recycling and recovery targets that have been laid down by the Irish Government .
These targets , which are to be achieved over the next fifteen years , include the following : -
· A diversion of 50 % of overall household waste from landfill sites .
· A minimum 65 % reduction in bio-degradable waste presently consigned for landfill sites .
· The development of waste recovery facilities , employing environmentally beneficial technologies capable of treating up to 300 000 tonnes of bio-degradable waste per annum .
All these measures reflect changing public opinions on the issue of waste management .
The day of landfill sites is now coming to an end and they must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies .
There is unanimous support for this position across all the fifteen Member States of the European Union .
. ( FR ) The enormous volume of waste generated by our industrialised urban societies is undoubtedly one of the major challenges to be overcome by the European Union in the 21st century .
Imperceptibly , the planet is gradually being swamped with waste and each year another 2 billion tonnes are produced by the Member States .
On environmental matters , it is by doing what is immediately possible that we will have a chance of achieving what is desirable in the long term .
This is why the UEN Group has not supported the amendments which are inapplicable in our Member States and whose anticipated economic consequences could prove to be very harmful .
Otherwise , as a local elected representative , I hope that the merger and simplification of the Community directives will clarify and streamline the regulatory framework in which the departmental waste management plans must be established .
Furthermore , if this directive were to come into force immediately , rather than in 2005 as is unfortunately the case , it would be virtually impossible for the Portuguese Government to continue with its co-incineration strategy .
Accordingly , although I would have liked to go further with restrictions on incineration and co-incineration processes , I am nevertheless delighted with what has been achieved , given that this directive :
1 . Establishes stricter limit values for emissions , in particular those of carbon oxides and particulates .
2 . Will put incineration and co-incineration plants on the same footing in terms of limit values , removing the special status granted to co-incineration plants .
3 . States without any doubt whatsoever that incineration and co-incineration may only be used as a last resort , once all other technical avenues have been explored .
4 . Sets extremely rigid conditions for overall waste management and for the siting and size of incineration and co-incineration plants , which must be complied with before permission can be granted to any authority .
5 . Increases the relevant authorities ' powers of intervention in case of non-compliance with limit values at installations .
6 . Drastically reduces the scope for using the end waste from incineration and co-incineration , particularly in civil engineering projects .
7 . Makes continuous sampling of dioxins a compulsory requirement in incineration and co-incineration processes .
8 . Increases the role of the public in decision making on the siting of installations .
9 . Makes it compulsory to publish an annual environmental report on compliance with limit values .
10 . Considerably limits the present derogations for cement kilns .
11 . For the first time sets a limit value for emissions of ammonia , NH3 , in view of the atmospheric acidification caused by this chemical product .
The proposed directive on waste incineration is a complex and technical document whose environmental and economic implications must be carefully considered .
At first reading the European Parliament really made its mark on the issue by proposing the merger of two directives on the incineration of domestic waste and the incineration of hazardous waste .
I now believe that the common position submitted by the Council is a very good compromise which I can support .
However , I must make one specific point about co-incineration in cement works and justify my vote against two amendments .
I voted against the first part of Amendment No 25 , amending Annex II , which sets emission limit values for the cement industry and in particular the value of 15 mg / m3 for dust .
The majority of the Member States currently have limit values of 50 mg / m3 .
In a recent cost-benefit analysis , the Commission concluded that values of 30 mg / m3 are the best compromise .
To impose limit values of 15 mg / m3 would involve an excessive environmental cost and would not be profitable .
I also voted against Amendment No 14 on the definition of municipal waste . This amendment reintroduces a definition of mixed municipal waste even though this is already specified in Article 3 ( 3 ) .
Incorrect interpretation of this article could lead to the use of municipal waste in cement kilns being excluded whereas this type of treatment is provided for by the waste plans of several public authorities .
This vote is not at odds with my environmental concerns as co-incineration in cement works is not particularly harmful for the environment . Cement kilns are actually subject to strict emission rules .
Moreover , co-incineration is , in certain cases , an integral part of the waste management policies of certain Member States or regions , under conditions which are both economically and environmentally acceptable .
- ( SV ) More stringent rules for incineration plants are highly desirable .
Plants for unsorted waste require more advanced equipment .
If the same requirements are laid down for all types of incineration plant , the effect could be to hinder the sorting of rubbish and to make recycling and reuse more difficult , including composting organic waste .
We in the Swedish Christian Democratic Party would therefore like to encourage the Commission to pay close attention to these points of view during the continued work on the issues of rubbish and waste .
I studied this report from my standpoint as a mayor because the Commission proposal mainly reinforces current legislation on the incineration of municipal waste .
The directive ' s objective is commendable . It aims to prevent and reduce the negative effects of waste incineration and co-incineration .
However , we cannot support the proposal as it also aims to subject all plants to the same emission standards .
This is not the way to deal with the overcapacity of incinerators in Europe and the rapporteur agrees with this .
Certain waste flows are more easily treated in a co-incineration plant .
With regard to municipal waste , I have several comments to make .
Firstly , confusion should not be allowed about the definition of ' mixed municipal waste ' in the context of co-incineration .
However , thinking on this issue must be taken into account and research must be continued .
The waste treatment industry will have to be very inventive in the future to avoid actually causing pollution .
We must therefore develop broader waste management strategies and actively encourage research and development in this area which is essential for life and for the future of our local authorities .
- I find it incredible , given the anti-Brussels hysteria of his UKIP allies , that Mr Blokland has managed to produce such an over-regulated monster of a report .
But at least these proposals will allow the anti-European rubbish peddled by Mr Blokland and the UKIP to be disposed of in an environmentally-friendly manner .
The aim of these proposals is to improve air quality and protect human health .
Incineration is often the most effective and safe method of waste disposal .
Sometimes , however , it can release dangerous chemicals , such as dioxins , into the atmosphere .
It is therefore vital that these by-products are monitored and prevented from escaping into the environment .
The technology for cleaning up fumes from waste incineration plants already exists .
We just need to make sure that it is used .
The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of this technology .
I find the UKIP 's hypocrisy breathtaking .
I challenge the UKIP to explain to their own supporters how they can be allied to such an obvious supporter of EU over-regulation .
While pretending to be the Eurocrat 's foe , they are clearly , in fact , the Eurocrat 's friend .
I fear that cleaning up the environment may prove to be a doddle compared to the task of persuading the UKIP to clean up its act .
The losers , sadly , will be our own citizens .
If we are to believe the texts of the Ancients , waste disposal was a problem in ancient Rome even though , since then , this waste has made generations of archaeologists very happy .
At the time the majority of the waste was biodegradable which is far from being the case today .
We have just been talking about chocolate .
We are facing an enormous challenge in terms of waste management .
However , I believe that some countries are not prepared for this either practically or theoretically .
One-third of domestic and similar waste treated by French disposal plants is currently handled by three hundred incinerators .
This incineration generates polluting emissions of dust , metals and dioxins which must be controlled using a smoke treatment system .
The regulations on the limitation of discharges are gradually being reinforced .
Clearly , action is needed to ensure that the rules are respected because health and the environment must be protected . However , in terms of co-incineration , the scope and definition of these plants should not be altered .
Amendments to the legislation on co-incinerators or the specific treatment of hazardous waste risk creating cost distortions or even causing unjustified transportation of waste elsewhere .
My colleagues should also note another point , although this is of less importance .
In my opinion , however , an information campaign is needed following the merger of these directives .
The people of Europe are under the impression that special , hazardous , non-hazardous and municipal waste will all be mixed together and undergo common treatment in the same kiln and in the same plant .
The sorting of waste which they carry out therefore appears to be useless .
We must therefore set up a proper information and explanatory campaign .
Davies report ( A5-0062 / 2000 )
This debate on air quality concerns the particular problem of ozone in ambient air , as set out in the Davies report .
All the experts agree that it is essential to raise standards of air quality so that people throughout the European Union are protected effectively against health risks posed by ozone in ambient air .
The various health effects of ozone include irritation to eyes , nose and throat , difficulty in breathing , coughs and headaches . Ozone also contributes to asthmatic attacks , impaired lung function and increased bronchial reactivity .
In the long term , this can even cause premature ageing of lungs .
These facts are frightening to say the least , which is why I warmly welcome this proposed directive .
It aims to amend the existing Community legislation on ozone in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 96 / 62 / EC on ambient air quality assessment and management .
It sets long-term objectives and interim target values for ozone in ambient air .
It also introduces a framework of standards to protect human health and the environment .
Finally , it requires Member States to monitor ozone concentrations and to report the results to the public .
The directive will therefore provide a benchmark for the levels of ozone in ambient air .
In setting long-term objectives , the Commission proposes to use the 1997 World Health Organisation air quality guidelines .
The ultimate aim is to prevent these long-term objectives being exceeded and thereby avoid harmful effects on human health and the environment .
However , the Commission ' s proposals do not set a deadline for this to be achieved .
This is to be regretted .
As a first interim step , target values are set .
The aim is to achieve these , as far as possible , by 2010 .
These are also based on the WHO guidelines , but it is accepted that these will be exceeded on a number of days each year .
It must be pointed out that the Commission proposal does not take account of any changes which may result from the Community ' s climate change commitments .
These currently call for an 8 % reduction in a range of greenhouse gases .
Success in meeting these commitments should enable Member States to be more ambitious regarding target values for the reduction of ozone levels .
Myller report ( A5-0063 / 2000 )
We are today debating a legislative proposal which affects us all directly as it aims to improve ambient air quality .
This proposed directive concerns national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants and comes under the framework directive on air quality .
It is part of the Community ' s fifth Environmental Action Programme or EAP .
The ceilings indicated in this text must be complied with by 2010 at the latest .
Member States are therefore required to draw up programmes for the progressive reduction of their annual national emissions and report these to the Commission before the end of 2002 .
The programmes are to be updated and revised by 2006 .
Member States are also required to prepare , and regularly update , national emission inventories and emission projections for 2010 for SO2 , NOx , VOCs and NH3 .
These inventories and projections must be reported to the Commission each year .
The rapporteur has proposed amendments to reinforce this proposal .
In particular , she suggests setting stricter standards for emissions of the four pollutants in question .
In principle I can only agree with these proposals .
When it comes to protecting health and the environment we must be ambitious if we really want to improve the situation .
However , setting the standards too high can be counterproductive .
This is why I believe that at the moment we should keep to the objectives set in the international conventions . These ceilings can , of course , be revised in light of future progress .
The report also asks the Commission to propose new amendments to the directive by 2004 .
The Commission could , in this way , revise the ceilings set in the text , the interim environmental targets and the new measures adopted to ensure respect for these ceilings .
These amendments could ensure that the directive is brought into line with technical and scientific developments and would allow the objectives to potentially be achieved by 2010 .
I feel this is a good compromise .
The rapporteur also proposes setting target dates for achieving these objectives . This is essential .
Without compulsory deadlines , texts are all too often simply declarations of intent which achieve nothing .
In the same respect , penalties applicable to infringements of the directive ' s provisions must be established as quickly as possible .
We are in favour of the EU creating fixed limit values in connection with the environment by means of framework legislation , as most environmental problems are general and transnational .
Each Member State has different traditions and requirements , which is why the Member States themselves should be responsible for implementation , ensuring that the common goals can be achieved in a satisfactory way .
Motion for a resolution on the Lisbon European Council
Despite current growth , job creation in Europe is notoriously inadequate .
Those jobs which are created tend to be precarious , particularly where they involve women and young people .
We must move away from simple declarations of intent , no matter how positive they may be .
In view of the extremely high social expectations , we must urgently define measurable and verifiable objectives .
What I would have liked to see was a commitment on the proposals indicated in my Group ' s motion such as :
The introduction of a process for reducing working time without any loss of wages or flexibility ;
A review of the directives on Euroworks councils and collective redundancies to reinforce the rights and powers of employees and their trade unions , particularly in the event of mergers and restructuring ;
The establishment at Community level of taxation on speculative capital movements and reinforcement of the fight against fraud and tax evasion .
For all these reasons we will vote against the joint motion .
This initiative is to be congratulated .
Unemployment and the resulting poverty and social exclusion are scourges which we must tackle head-on .
The preparation of a coherent and coordinated strategy involving all the Member States is therefore essential .
We must firstly set ambitious objectives .
Those indicated in the Portuguese presidency ' s document are the return to full employment , stable growth , a genuine process of social cohesion , equal opportunities and the fight against poverty .
As underlined by the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Guterres , we were able to coordinate our economic policies to launch the euro .
The European Union must now accept the challenge and proceed in a similar fashion by proposing guidelines for the policy on employment and social inclusion .
I also welcome the idea of setting quantified objectives and benchmarks , in particular an annual average growth rate in the EU of 3 % and a level of employment of 70 % .
The presidency ' s document also stresses the necessary reinforcement of social convergence and the modernisation of our social protection systems .
The essential condition is clearly to guarantee a high level of employment .
This requires the creation of jobs , not just any jobs , but quality jobs , particularly in the service sector .
It also involves keeping jobs in Europe , given that the recent trend has been mass and systematic redundancies .
This means that the workforce has to adapt to the new information technologies .
I therefore broadly support this programme .
I hope these objectives will lead , during the Lisbon Summit , to specific and ambitious measures which can meet the legitimate expectations of the male and female citizens of Europe .
In fact , what the economic and social policy guidelines are promoting , what they are striving for in practice , is a minimum level of poverty , not a minimum level of prosperity for workers .
You will find them fighting for a social , democratic , mutually supportive Europe , a workers ' Europe , a Europe of the people , and you will find us by their side , fighting with them .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Human rights , racism , xenophobia and antisemitism ( continuation )
Ladies and gentlemen , the next item is the continuation of the joint debate on four reports on human rights , racism , xenophobia and antisemitism .
Madam President , I should like to expressly thank Mr Belder for his report .
Racism , xenophobia and antisemitism are a depressing problem , including within the European Union .
Fighting them is one of the common goals of almost every political group in this House .
This House is prepared to exercise diplomatic restraint in many areas , but not on this question .
And rightly so .
Mr Belder knows that I and the committee wished to quote the specifics of individual problems in candidate countries .
A number of proposed amendments by Baroness Ludford attempt to rectify this and I shall support them .
The way in which the social causes of racism in candidate countries and the highly significant social and employment policy consequences of a consistent anti-racist policy have been dealt with appears to me to be too general .
The fact that Mr Belder was prepared to clearly address the question of antisemitism is one of the most important results of the discussion process and I again extend my thanks to Mr Belder .
There is almost a total lack of analytical appraisal or special programmes to combat it .
And as far as the Commission programmes in the candidate countries are concerned , Commissioner , the word " almost " can be dispensed with .
I consider this an unacceptable oversight and I therefore refer this question to you specifically .
Antisemitism is , without doubt , widespread ; often it is latent , which complicates the issue .
This morning in this House we were witness to one of its most repulsive forms , when the age-old assertion that the Jews themselves are responsible for antisemitism was repeated .
This debate should therefore be a separate and very , very specific task for us and the Commission .
Madam President , the presentation by the Council of a first EU annual report on human rights was a welcome contribution to the on-going debate .
In particular I welcome the information it contains regarding the EU-China human rights dialogue .
Too often in the past EU Member States have allowed themselves to be blackmailed by China .
Capitulating to China was both immoral and cowardly .
It was immoral to extend greater priority to the importance of trade interests over human rights and is in marked contrast to our approach in relation to the bilateral trade agreements we have with developing countries .
It was cowardly also .
History has consistently shown that the correct approach is to stand up to a bully .
Attempts to compromise are always interpreted as weakness by bullies , and China is such a bully .
We see this in its response to legitimate international concerns about its human rights record .
It treats the views of the outside world with contempt .
We witnessed it again at last week 's conference of the National People 's Congress in Beijing .
Its warmongering tone in relation to Taiwan is unacceptable and is a direct interference in Taiwan 's presidential election .
Its arrogance in relation to its treatment of Falun Gong practitioners and dissidents also cannot be tolerated .
In Geneva , and elsewhere , the EU should take every opportunity in a united way to express its displeasure .
While I strongly support China 's admission to the WTO , we should give China a dose of its own medicine .
We should use these negotiations as a means of leverage to ensure that China not only listens to EU concerns about its continued abuse of human rights but that it also takes action to improve its record .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , if we are to reinforce the protection of human rights in the European Union , we must firstly concern ourselves with the most vulnerable , i.e. essentially , the poorest .
The most basic violation of human rights is the denial of each individual ' s right to live decently . Respect for human dignity must be our guide .
The aim is to create acceptable living conditions for all .
Everyone must be protected from poverty and exclusion .
Everyone is entitled to education , culture and health .
Everyone is entitled to decent housing and an income which allows them to live honourably .
We must declare that poverty will not be tolerated .
We must declare that everyone is entitled to their physical and mental integrity and that this integrity involves the right to a decent life .
Could the idea of fraternity become the key concept for the 21st century ?
Everyone has in them the enduring need to dream and through fraternity we could meet our main expectations for the poorest in society .
Fraternity gives meaning to solidarity , rejects exclusion and solitude , and ensures respect for differences .
Fraternity must guarantee the rights of the poorest .
Our century will be a century of progress in which the wildest utopian ideals may be realised .
Fraternity is one of these ideals and together , ladies and gentlemen , we can achieve it .
I would like to compliment the President on the wise decision to take these four reports together .
And we still have a long way to go as regards violence by the police and in prisons , and in combating racism and xenophobia .
Madam President , even to a slightly unprejudiced eye , there is clearly no trace of racism down the broad middle of this House .
Even if we disagree on a report on racism , the reasons lie not in racism in Parliament but in the report itself .
And it is precisely on these points that this report is a dishonest and sorry effort and I make no bones about the fact .
The fight against racism , to which we are all committed , is turned into small political currency and abused , which is why we are unable to vote for the report in its present form .
I stand firmly against the way in which racism has been played down , as we have said , to make it a subject of political debate .
That is our grave criticism of the approach taken in this report .
We are all against racism and we all have a contribution to make .
There should be a broad consensus on this in this House .
I believe it has a place here .
What was happening 15 years ago in Austria was that Mr Haider was actually persecuting the Slovene-speaking minority there .
Very few of us wanted to stand up and say anything at the time .
We need to tell the Estonians and the Latvians that , if they continue that treatment , their prospects of joining the European Union will be that much less .
Madam President , both I and my Group enthusiastically support Mr Haarder ' s human rights report because we have found a very good line in it and there are numerous reasons for doing so .
Allow me to tell you which points we do not accept and why .
They are the points which fall outside the stated report period of 1997 / 98 .
And when Sarah Ludford says the report refers to the year 2000 , then she must be clairvoyant because it has only just begun .
Secondly , we are against all the points which fly in the face of the basic principle of solidarity .
Mr Nassauer has already pointed out the fact that intervention in the right to hold public office has been called for here .
Has the author ever tried to enter public office in Morocco for example ?
The question of recruitment to public office in a Member State or to the police is exclusively a matter for that Member State .
Thirdly , matters are addressed which have no place in this report , such as the voting rights of third country nationals in European elections or local elections .
I consider this last point to be very important .
These are actions which , in the final analysis , are directed against young people , the economy , sport and the people of my country , and they have no place in this report .
The report does not contain what the title promises .
Madam President , thanks are due to Mr Haarder for a basically splendid piece of work .
There is , nonetheless , one point on which I have to say that I disagree with the rapporteur .
I believed and hoped that I could declare myself in agreement with Mr Haarder in emphasising the individual ' s right to membership of trade unions .
When , however , the report is read in other languages , it can be seen that Mr Haarder has not grown wiser . Either that , or he is hiding it very well .
Madam President , I notice that you have not called Mr Hernández Mollar , who had asked me to speak on his behalf .
I will therefore present Mr Hernández Mollar ' s intervention .
Madam President , the debate on xenophobia and racism is always of great importance , politically and socially .
The Ludford report contains points which are highly acceptable and which any democrat can and must ratify , but also contains other points which are less than rigorous from a political and even from a legal point of view .
European citizenship is an abstract concept which lacks any legal form .
The Member States regulate the political rights of their citizens in accordance with their own democratic laws , as also happens in many of the countries of origin of the citizens who emigrate to the European Union .
It would be impossible to comply with a proposal of this type and I therefore ask Mrs Ludford to withdraw it so that we can vote in favour of her report .
That was Mr Hernández Mollar ' s intervention .
I will now begin my own , Madam President .
The existence of a panoply of fundamental civil , economic , social and political rights , fully guaranteed by constitutional legislation and by public authorities , is one of the essential elements of modern Western society .
The European Union has always considered the respect for fundamental human rights to be one of the essential principles of its founding spirit and has engraved this on the frontispiece of its founding Treaties .
However , that firm and unequivocal will must be exercised in a manner which is legally rigorous and , above all , based on common sense .
The nationals of non-EU states who live in the Union must be treated on an equal footing with the citizens of the Member States with regard to access to education , health and social protection .
This must be done whilst respecting their specific religious beliefs and cultural characteristics .
The tiniest hint of racism , intolerance or xenophobia must be eradicated in any Member State in which it may occur .
However , the administrative status of the resident is not the same as the political status of the citizen .
However , full political citizenship must be acquired in accordance with the laws of each Member State .
Many of the tragedies of the twentieth century in Europe have resulted from ignoring this wise advice .
Let us allow Renan to refresh our memories , but let us not indulge in excesses which are less than rational and of dubious morality .
Madam President , I would like to express my appreciation for Mr Belder ' s report , which is also the topic of my contribution today .
The report raises many relevant points .
Many indeed , such as the issue of racism and discrimination in the candidate countries , require a great deal of attention .
However , in my contribution , I would like to home in on the predicament of the Roma people , otherwise known as gypsies .
Many Roma in the candidate Member States live in extremely abject conditions .
They are frequently at the receiving end of all kinds of discrimination .
Under the communist regime , they were subjected to an assimilation policy . After this , after 1989 , they were more or less left to fend for themselves .
For a long time , little attention was given to their predicament , but fortunately , the Council of Europe was the first to raise the alarm .
In the light of enlargement , the Commission has now also accorded their problem priority status , and rightly so .
Many governments in the candidate Member States concerned have also become active on this score , and many of us have noticed the sudden influx of gypsy groups into a number of Member States .
We want the European Union to get more directly involved in order to address the problems of the Roma .
Not only the European Commission but also this Parliament would do well to pay a lot more attention to this .
This should , first and foremost , be placed within a broader context .
We should not just aim to combat discrimination and change people ' s mentality .
We also need to address the causes of discrimination .
Regional developments and a sound social policy are indispensable tools in this .
Roma often live in areas where everyone is struggling .
We want to adopt an approach from a local perspective .
Local communities and local governments play a key role in solving the problems of the Roma .
This is the level at which improvement programmes need to be drawn up in the areas of education , housing and employment . They must be organised in such a way as to ensure that the entire population benefits .
At the same time , local cooperation is an effective tool against prejudice and discrimination .
Only at a local level can the negative cycle of disadvantage and discrimination be broken .
The Roma ' s own contribution is also important . As far as I am concerned , this too is a key word .
Roma need to be able to stand up for themselves more .
They need to become directly involved and given co-responsibility in order to improve their conditions .
In my opinion , official recognition of the Roma as a minority could help them to achieve more political independence .
In addition , there is a need for more specific action aimed at changing people ' s mentality .
The tendency to discriminate is often deep-rooted , even at government level .
This needs to be given special attention .
I also advocate sound cooperation between the European Union and the Council of Europe .
We should make better use of the expertise developed within these circles .
Finally , I would like to underline that , more than anything , there is a great need for tangible results in the short term .
Many campaigns are being launched with a great deal of good will and the European Union is very active too .
This is praiseworthy in itself .
Some investments require a lot of time and it takes a long time before they take effect , but other aspects , such as housing and tackling the employment issues , can yield tangible results sooner .
We must address the problems facing the Roma in the candidate Member States themselves , which is , after all , where they live .
In fact , we should do this as soon as possible in order to avoid this problem becoming our problem in six years or so .
Mr President , human rights , fundamental freedoms and the rule of law are the alpha and omega of any political system .
We take them for granted , but it appears that in our ultra-civilised Europe they are not always observed .
Mr Haarder has described the situation within the 15 Member States , and the implication is that there is certainly much work still to be done .
For example , it is an inadmissible , almost bewildering fact that , even today , some countries are denounced by Amnesty International for failure to respect the most basic human rights .
It is absurd that some states , including , sadly , my native country , are being condemned by the European Court of Human Rights over the exaggerated length of their legal proceedings .
The fact that the institution of exile is still in force in some Member States is incompatible with all the principles of human rights .
However , where there is political responsibility this should not be a problem .
We must overcome this and incite our governments to be European through and through .
I am not the first person to say this : the European Union is not , cannot and must not be a purely economic union .
The European Union is something much greater than that ; it has a common origin and a dream which we must fight to realise , and civil rights are an integral part of that fight .
Mr President , we might call today ' s sitting a sitting in celebration of human rights .
Those with ulterior motives might say that Europe is engaging in self-flagellation .
I believe that Europe is reviving its hopes and its prospects .
Human rights issues spearhead and underpin the development of Europe .
And when it comes to human rights , we must never ever make concessions .
We demand various criteria of the countries which will accede and of other countries , wherever they may be .
The death penalty is an example .
And yet we have an ally , America , in which the death penalty both exists and is used .
All four reports on which we shall be voting are good reports .
They need some improvement and I think that the entire House will help without any expediency or ulterior motive .
In particular , Mr Belder ' s report on candidate countries is a very good report and I hope that , in the end , it will be even better .
I am tempted for the sake of quality , and because I wish to participate and because I agree , to read two paragraphs , two proposals relating to two candidate countries .
Cyprus - Cyprus satisfies the Copenhagen criteria .
In passing , it should be said that there has been no progress in resolving the political partition of the island .
Turkey - The Commission report notes no progress on the fundamental Kurdish issue .
In short , Turkey still fails to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria .
We are in favour of Turkey ' s joining the European Union .
However , we must not make concessions on questions of principle for anyone .
It is based on fundamental European values which , per se , vehemently oppose racism , xenophobia and antisemitism .
I think that only if we base our position on these fundamental values inside the European Union are we entitled to criticise others outside the Union , in places where these fundamental values are violated .
There are various sections of the population in the candidate countries , in the candidate countries , which merit our particular attention .
We must also admit that there is a problem in this regard because the Roma and Sinti themselves have different conceptions of how this integration can function .
But we must help them with training .
The second group which I should like to mention are the Kurds .
Turkey , which is a candidate country even if we are not yet negotiating with it , recognises no minorities , not even the Kurdish minority .
I consider this stance to be wrong and one which contradicts the declarations of the Council of Europe .
I therefore think it extremely important that we help the Kurds gain their rights in a reasonable and peaceful manner .
The Belder report also states this unequivocally .
The third group which I should like to make special mention of is to be found mainly in Estonia and Latvia . I refer to the Russian-speaking minorities .
There are many emotional obstacles to this and yet it is important to take these steps and some have certainly been taken .
The Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia will open in Vienna on 7 April .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not intend this to be a very long speech .
I believe that the debate we have had here today is an extremely important one , and that the various concerns that have been expressed in relation to the various reports have raised some interesting questions .
I have referred to our external presence and to the internal dimension .
A great deal has been said today , either directly or indirectly , about the stance adopted towards Austria .
This was sometimes expressed in a rather emotional way , I might even say in an understandably emotional way , on the part of individuals linked with that country .
Austria has undeniably been a country that has met its European Union obligations .
But we have to recognise one thing that has a significant bearing on how we view the European Union : we are all Austrian citizens .
Today , in the European Union , citizenship means European citizenship .
An Austrian citizen is a Portuguese citizen .
A Portuguese citizen is an Austrian citizen .
This cannot be viewed as a matter of indifference to the other countries .
We are now operating within a European area , a common area within which we regard ourselves as being bound by a basic set of principles , many of which are highlighted in the reports before us here .
That simply is not true .
As I have already said , Austria ' s internal affairs are also the European Union ' s internal affairs .
We believe that political precautions of this kind are possibly the best way of warding off future problems , and in particular the ghosts from the past that may return to haunt us in Europe .
There are naturally some controversial issues in this area , and people may see things in various different lights in different areas .
And there is going to be an interesting test of this , in the form of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of citizens of the European Union .
Furthermore , as regards antidiscrimination and the various forms of discrimination identified in the various reports , a great many differing measures obviously exist .
And we know that even when it comes to internal legislation within our Member States , there are major differences in the way some of these questions are dealt with .
This is a task not just for governments , but also for non-governmental organisations , for social lobbies and for political lobbies .
We need to keep this question on our agenda , and that is the rationale and the significance of this debate .
The measures that have been developed include a set of initiatives connected with the European Year against Racism in 1997 .
I would also like to highlight a very important aspect which we have probably not yet fully taken into account : the role of the new Treaty of Amsterdam in this area .
Our present experience suggests that it would probably be advisable to improve these provisions , that is to improve these articles .
We shall see whether , in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference , we can achieve a consensus that will allow us to make further progress on this matter .
However , I would also like to draw attention to an initiative that will , symbolically , take place in Vienna on 8 April - the launch of the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia .
This essentially represents what we might call the " ethical pillar " of the Union .
Madam President , at the end of this extremely interesting debate perhaps I can explain the division of labour or work-sharing on the Commission 's side .
Let me start with the Malmström report .
I think the first annual report of this new European Parliament is thorough and timely .
Timely , because I hope that before the summer break this equally new Commission will adopt a communication on human rights in external policies .
It will cover many of the areas in the report and all the European Parliament 's recommendations provide extremely useful input for our work .
I want to concentrate my initial remarks on women 's and children 's rights , as the rapporteur has chosen to focus on these important objects .
It is a timely choice in view of the Beijing + 5 platform for action this year at the UN General Assembly in New York .
Beijing confirmed that women 's rights are universal human rights and that women have a central role to play in building democratic and just societies .
The European initiative for democracy and human rights reflects this .
Women are explicitly included as a target group for support .
The actions cover a broad sweep of concerns , from women 's participation in decision making in the Balkans to support for female domestic workers in the Ivory Coast .
Issues such as violence against women have been rightly categorised as issues of human rights .
As such , they should be promoted vigorously as part and parcel of our foreign policy and development assistance .
Mrs Malmström 's report sets out some of the stark realities of the violence which is perpetrated against women in many forms and at all levels of society .
From the horrors of rape to genital mutilation , from the home to the prison cell .
Our programmes DAPHNE and STOP are the mainstay of the Commission 's response .
DAPHNE has supported the sharing of information and good practice amongst NGOs and Member States through more than 100 transnational projects .
A new DAPHNE programme for 2000-2003 was adopted in December 1999 at a level of EUR 5 m a year .
In response to a European Parliament resolution in 1997 the Commission has conducted an awareness-raising campaign on domestic violence within the Member States .
We should use what we learn during such campaigns and share that knowledge with applicant countries , perhaps in the context of DAPHNE .
I take note of what the report says on the horrific practice of genital mutilation and the lack of data on the subject .
We will look , in the Commission , at ways in which we can contribute to the search for a solution .
The Commission is also working with others to halt the heinous trafficking of women which has been growing in the last few years .
We produced a communication in 1998 on this subject . The focus then was placed on prevention , research , law enforcement , effective sentencing of traffickers and support to victims .
We are working on this , as the honourable Member knows , with NGOs , the OSCE and candidate countries .
A new STOP programme is planned to start from this year and this will be open to accession countries .
Moving on to more general issues , I mentioned the forthcoming communication on human rights and external relations .
My aim is to adopt a more effective and coherent approach to policy and to spending and in particular to improve the management of our programmes in this area .
Human rights projects are very different from projects to build bridges or reinforce primary education .
NGOs and civil society partners are integral to their implementation .
The projects are often carried out in sensitive or dangerous conditions in the field .
The former is clearly as impossible as it would be totally undesirable .
We could not work without NGOs .
We will not , alas , see an overnight change .
This brings me on to the budget and the Parliament 's proposal for a joint declaration on yearly increases in human rights expenditure .
The size of the budget cannot be divorced from the question of our capacity to manage it .
Otherwise we will make too many promises which we simply cannot fulfil and when it comes to supporting NGOs you often operate on a shoestring .
Broken promises can lead rapidly to bankruptcy .
But I want to make this clear : I would like to put myself in a position as soon as I can where we spend every penny and can therefore justify spending a great deal more .
The possibility of creating a human rights agency as foreseen in Vienna and Cologne could help us here .
I believe that such an agency should be operational , not advisory .
I will be exploring this in the communication .
The potential for an agency should also be considered in the context of wider reform of our external assistance and of externalisation as a whole .
I now turn to the issues raised in the Belder report which responds to the Commission ' s communication on countering racism , xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate countries .
I am responding to this on my own behalf and that of my colleague , Commissioner Verheugen .
I would like to congratulate the authors of the comprehensive report .
I hope this response will set a few pointers for the future .
The fight against racism is an essential element of the Union ' s human rights policies and of the pre-accession strategy .
The compatibility of legislation concerning minorities is raised during the screening process and during bilateral discussions and in association committees .
For example , we have looked at language laws in Lithuania , Estonia and Slovakia , a subject that was raised during the debates , and legislation regarding the Roma in the Czech Republic and Slovakia .
These discussions have produced concrete results .
The second element , our cooperation programmes , include the PHARE national programmes , PHARE Democracy and the MEDA Programme .
Under PHARE , reform of the police , criminal justice and asylum systems has been accorded a high priority in line with the rapporteurs ' proposals .
This reform helps to bring about the necessary changes in attitudes within institutions .
The goal of raising police awareness of racism and xenophobia was also incorporated in the framework of the European curriculum for the training of the police in Central and Eastern Europe .
We will persevere with such measures .
We are also open to opportunities for strengthening them .
One central aim common to the Malmström and the Belder reports is the need to build on our relationship with NGOs in candidate countries .
The new Access Programme which replaces the LIEN and Partnership Programmes aims to strengthen civil society .
Finally , on the Roma , whose condition was mentioned by several speakers , the Commission is seeking to bring more coherence to its support for Roma communities .
These reports cover extremely important issues .
I look forward to the European Union taking up these abuses at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva , which I will attend on 27 March .
I am grateful to Parliament for its timely input .
The Commission and Parliament are well placed to work together on human rights .
We are well placed to give a strong lead to others .
Madam President , I too should like to ask in what capacity you made this statement .
My third comment , if you will allow , is addressed to you , Mr da Costa : what happens in one country of the European Union is of interest to the other countries , that is perfectly obvious .
That is not least precisely why we are members of this European Union and it is to be commended that we obtain information and evince an interest .
Minister , I should like to call on you on behalf of the Austrian delegation to obtain this information , which neither you nor many or , presumably all of the 14 , have , in situ .
It was not right-wing extremists , although , of course , we do unfortunately have them in Austria , perhaps in the order of 3 to 5 % , just as other countries do .
The motives here were different , however , and voters simply overwhelmingly voted the old government and Socialism out in favour of an alternative .
If you wish to pass value judgements here , please ensure that you are in possession of all the facts first and then levy criticism where it is really due and not on the basis of supposition or suspicion .
Madam President , Mr Pirker has not spoken on the agenda .
I should like it recorded that what Mr Pirker has said had nothing to do with the agenda .
I call on the President of the Council on behalf of my Group to continue to be as vigilant and critical of racism and xenophobia as you have demonstrated here , in whatever capacity .
Madam President , I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify once again the capacity in which I made those observations .
Let there be no mistake : the statement by the President of the European Council and Portuguese Prime Minister was made on behalf of the 14 countries in the European Union apart from Austria .
The 14 countries ' three levels of response as regards Austria are therefore bilateral in nature .
The fact that this was channelled through the President of the Council was merely a question of coordinating the joint position of the various countries .
The bilateral sanctions are therefore exactly that . They are not sanctions within the operational framework of the Community .
No formal aspect of the European Union ' s operational framework has come into play during the Portuguese presidency in relation to the Austrian situation .
It was not by chance that the party with the second largest vote in the Austrian elections was not invited to form the government .
It was not by chance that a party that received a larger number of votes was invited to form the government , but that it then passed on to the party with the third largest number of votes .
It was not by chance that the President of the Republic of Austria has obliged the two parties in the coalition government to make a declaration recognising a basic set of principles .
It was not by chance at all !
As regards Austria acting as a full partner within the Community , as it has done up to now , nothing will militate against Austria at Community level .
That is quite clear .
We regret that this is how things have to be and we hope that matters will develop in Austria in such a way that we can act differently .
The Commission is also pleased to note that its views are basically in agreement with those of the European Parliament on the nature and content of this Charter .
This was also the case in yesterday ' s debate on the Duff and Voggenhuber report and it is also true with regard to the conclusions of the report by Mr Haarder whom I warmly congratulate .
The signature of this Convention is certainly compatible with the preparation of a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights .
With regard to the content of the Haarder report , I will particularly concentrate on the aspects which come directly within my area of competence within the Commission .
The conclusions of the Tampere European Council provide a very clear political framework for the EU ' s policy on respecting and promoting migrants ' rights in the broad sense of the term .
I wish to confirm the importance which the Union and its Member States attach to absolute respect for the right to ask for asylum on the basis of a full and comprehensive application of the Geneva Convention .
I must also underline the intention to develop a vigorous policy on the integration of third country nationals legally resident on EU Member State territory .
I therefore share the rapporteur ' s and Parliament ' s concerns .
However , at the same time , the Commission intends , in the autumn , to submit to Parliament a communication on immigration policy in the European Union .
We must review the 1994 communication and update the approach to the questions of immigration policy in the Union in light of the Tampere conclusions .
As for civil justice , the communitisation of several civil justice instruments is an efficient way of ensuring the effective legal consideration of human rights .
The Commission has already proposed communitising all existing conventions not currently in force , particularly the one on the service of documents and the Brussels II Convention and the convention on bankruptcies .
We have also proposed making the very important Brussels Convention of 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters into a regulation .
All these instruments are currently being examined by the Council .
These measures will aim to go beyond the joint action of February 1997 .
They will consist of definitions , charges and penalties in the fight against the trade in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation and measures against the sexual exploitation of children .
Turning now to the Ludford report , I very much welcome the opportunity to respond to Parliament ' s report on racism and xenophobia .
The Union ' s commitment to supporting fundamental rights and fighting discrimination was made very clear in the Amsterdam Treaty and this is , for me , a crucial development of the European message .
Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union introduces new powers to react in case of serious and persistent breaches of fundamental rights by a Member State .
That is why we put forward our package of proposals to fight discrimination only two months after taking office last year .
But besides that , I think that in many quarters there is growing recognition of the need for European action against racism .
That is why in the Article 13 proposals we are able to make greater progress , I believe , on racial discrimination than on the other matters .
We felt that it was politically possible .
We sincerely hope that the facts will not deny our hope .
As you know , the package of proposals that the Commission has put forward consists of two directives and an action programme .
The two draft directives provide a legislative framework for legally enforceable rights including provisions on a number of key issues such as protection against harassment , scope for positive action , appropriate remedies and enforcement measures .
The proposed directives are complemented by a proposal for an action programme .
We know that , to combat discrimination , practical action is needed to reach out to people and help change discriminatory attitudes and behaviour on the ground .
Getting the Member States to adopt the anti-discrimination package is now our top priority .
Although it is important , the Article 13 package is only part of an on-going process to develop new ways of tackling racial discrimination .
The Union is committed to mainstreaming the fight against discrimination on the basis of race and ethnic origin , and we recently organised a major conference on this issue .
We intend to use all these instruments to fight discrimination and , as you know , work has also started on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Parliament has a key role to play in this regard .
I will conclude as I have started : the Charter will represent the high priority that the Union as a whole accords to the fight against racism and discrimination and to protection of human rights .
I sincerely hope that , during our debate on this issue next year , we will be congratulating ourselves on achieving , with the Charter , a new tool to fight against racism and xenophobia in the Union .
Madam President , allow me briefly to correct what the President-in-Office of the Council said .
Two heads of government , Mr President-in-Office , have already been reprimanded by their parliaments for the steps which they initiated against Austria .
You therefore had no right to speak on behalf of their countries ; on the contrary , you obviously spoke as the head of a socialist party .
At most , Mr President-in-Office , you can therefore only speak of twelve countries .
Mrs Flemming , the debate on Austria should not be restarted as we have already had an exchange of views on this issue .
I will give the floor to Mr Schulz who wanted to raise a point of order on a personal challenge made in yesterday ' s debate .
Madam President , I seldom make use of these rules but I must do so now for the record .
During the debate , Mr Gollnisch , a member of the French extreme right , attacked me personally .
I should like to state the following for the record : I have nothing to take back as regards my statement that the extreme right is abusing this House for rabble-rousing purposes .
Mr Gollnisch stated for my benefit during his speech that his family , and these were his words , would never accept fascism .
That is where Mr Gollnisch clearly differs from his family , because he himself accepts fascism or , to put it plainly , he is a fascist .
Mr Schulz , we have noted your statement .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
Eurodac
The next item is the joint debate on :
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , firstly I would like to thank the Presidency-in-Office of the Council for their high level presence in this House and for their positive attitude .
Last year , this Parliament was consulted twice about the establishment of a system for comparing fingerprints .
In principle , the system is intended to correctly implement the Dublin Convention .
On 13 April 1999 , this Parliament rejected the Council ' s proposal to extend the Eurodac system to illegal immigrants by means of a protocol .
This Parliament was then consulted again in accordance with the provisions of Amsterdam .
We were once again told that this system has to be developed in order to correctly implement the Dublin Convention .
Given that we have been informed that none of our suggestions are going to be accepted , I would like to ask the Council whether it is prepared to hold a genuine dialogue with Parliament .
This is not a trivial question .
We have all managed very well to really work together with you , and the same applies of course to Commissioner Vitorino .
But when it comes to EURODAC , we have a problem .
We here in Parliament have passed a resolution and have made clear why we cannot accept EURODAC in the form which the Council and the Commission wish it to take .
And we have given our reasons .
We have humane reasons , we have reasons when it comes to children , as far as the age limit is concerned ; for example we cannot accept the age limit of 14 .
We highlighted all these problems in a resolution by Parliament .
The question is whether you are willing to lend us an ear when something gives us cause for concern and we urgently need your support .
Mr President , esteemed Commissioners , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the debate on EURODAC and the implementation of this system is something of a never ending story .
It started back in Dublin in 1990 .
In November 1999 , we here in Parliament , and I assume you too Commissioner , believed that we were on the home stretch and were finally going to be able to implement EURODAC .
That too was a very positive aspect .
Plus , we could then prevent multiple applications for asylum and abuse of the asylum system and this , in turn , would allow us , as it were , to fight illegal immigration indirectly .
In other words , it is , as a whole , a system which must be seen as very positive and absolutely necessary in the context of asylum and immigration policy and the responsibility of the Member States .
My question to you is this : when can we really expect to see the EURODAC system which we have waited so long for up and running ?
How will the system actually be configured ?
This is the sole objective of the regulation , which is an instrument pursuant to the Dublin Convention and which goes no further than that objective .
As regards the role of the European Commission , Article 3 of the proposal for a regulation clearly defines that a Central Unit shall be set up within the Commission .
Furthermore , the Commission has , as we know , started to work on this , and preparations for establishing a Central Unit are under way .
Concerning the role of the European Parliament , I would like to clarify something that can only be the result of a misunderstanding .
Some of Parliament ' s amendments were in fact incorporated into the proposal for a regulation , which is a point I wish to stress .
We hope that this will happen shortly , perhaps even during the Portuguese Presidency .
With regard to the other questions raised here , the first was the minimum age for taking fingerprints , which has been set at 14 years .
I believe that these points mean we can say that this is a safe system without any aspects that could jeopardise citizens ' rights .
Mr President , the statements by the President-in-Office of the Council go straight to the heart of the problem facing us here .
The Social Democrats are divided , I make no bones about the fact , as to how to deal with fingerprinting of under 18-year olds .
Some members are saying we should not fingerprint fourteen- to eighteen-year-olds .
I personally take a different view on this .
You cannot advocate reducing the voting age to sixteen and still say that an eighteen-year-old should not be fingerprinted .
It is incomprehensible .
It comes down to how this system is seen under the rule of law .
However , the Council has not so far given us to understand this in so many words , which is why I listened to what you said with pleasure .
There is a lack of parliamentary scrutiny and no precise guaranteed legal recourse .
It is there in principle , but it has never been accurately described .
The same applies to parliamentary scrutiny .
We therefore say that if implementing powers remain with the Commission , if the regulatory committee is set up under the chairmanship of the Commission , then we agree .
If not , then we must tell the Council that there is no question of the Council taking implementing powers away from the Commission , not if it expects the Community budget to finance the system .
Otherwise Parliament would have to reconsider the budget and the question of financing the system from the community budget .
And believe me , we shall do so .
This is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy .
There is also an absence of clarity in the definition of the illegal immigrants to whom the regulation will apply .
Member States are required to fingerprint every third-country national over 14 who is apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of their border - that is not very precise .
Fingerprinting is a serious invasion of privacy and the compatibility of such requirements with the European Convention on Human Rights needs to be carefully weighed .
I am not sure that this has really been done .
Finally , Mr President , whatever the justification for widening the Eurodac fingerprinting system to some categories of illegal immigrants , I am personally not convinced that this proposal is legally watertight .
Are the Council and the Commission so convinced ?
Mr President , we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in Europe .
That means that we need instruments to exercise the necessary controls .
A common immigration law means that we have no more internal borders and take responsibility for the people entering the European Union at the external borders .
It is perfectly clear that there is abuse , for example in connection with asylum claims .
The number of people applying for asylum on grounds which have nothing to do with political persecution far outweighs the number of applicants recognised as victims of political persecution .
Abuse in this connection means not only that asylum is sought on non-existent grounds but also that the same applicants make applications on these grounds to several countries .
It has already proven its efficacy on several counts , and it is essential if asylum is to gain acceptance .
We therefore advise the Council in the strongest terms to make its decisions so that EURODAC , the system which allows fingerprinting throughout Europe , can become a fact of life .
That is the task now before the Council .
Ladies and gentlemen , as we have been told by the Council representatives , the amendments adopted by Parliament and included in the text have improved the draft regulation .
However , this is still unacceptable to us as it stigmatises third country nationals and tends to criminalise them .
Moreover , this draft regulation concerns us basically because we feel that it is not needed yet .
It is , we feel , putting the cart before the horse .
We are using and establishing instruments before we have developed a proper harmonised policy on the right to freedom of movement , the right to live as a family and the right of asylum .
We should start by harmonising this policy . We can look at the instruments for implementation and control after that .
Finally , a third point which particularly concerns us is the dismissal of Parliament ' s opinion .
This raises a vital question about the democratic credit granted to the Members of the European Parliament .
It is a shame that we are currently being given the impression that we serve no useful purpose .
We are told that this is just a case of abstention but this is actually the norm as Members ' opinions are not being taken into account .
With Eurodac , the Commission and the Council are , in my view , going too far in their desire to monitor asylum seekers and other citizens of third countries who cross the border into Fortress Europe .
The Eurodac initiative is a series of absurdities and outrages .
To confuse asylum seekers with illegal immigrants contravenes the Convention on Refugees .
Those human and fundamental rights which are so much talked about have no value if we are not in a position to guarantee them in practice , and on behalf of those who penetrate Fortress Europe as well .
What I would therefore urge the Commission and the Council to do is to allow Eurodac to die a peaceful death , as it deserves to do .
In my view , the purpose is to safeguard the rights of asylum seekers , and there is no question of infringing the rights of those who honestly and legitimately request asylum .
I cannot imagine that either the Council or the Commission might wish to construct this system in such a way that it could include restrictions of any kind upon the freedom of law-abiding citizens .
The system is quite in accordance with the creation of an area of freedom and justice , and this is something we support .
I personally am among those who have serious reservations about the system .
Apart from that , the fingerprinting system per se has negative associations with criminal investigations by police authorities and criminal offences .
In all events , the European Parliament is calling for the right to exercise parliamentary scrutiny , in which case the Council and the Commission will have the final word on the matter .
However , I think that the best thing the European Commission and the Council can do is to institute a common asylum and immigration policy based on European humanitarian and democratic values and respect for human rights .
I would also like to confirm , as the representative of the Council has already said , that there is a problem concerning the territorial application of the Eurodac regulation .
I can also confirm that the Council did not ask the Commission to come forward with a revised proposal .
The Commission , in this case , has a different position from both the Council and Parliament .
In its revised proposal the Commission takes on board the solution proposed by Parliament that the data should be deleted from the base as soon as someone is recognised as a refugee .
On the other hand , we did not subscribe to the idea of Parliament about the age limit for fingerprinting .
We considered that 14 years old is an adequate solution .
It is inconceivable for me that my country is one which criminalises all children of 10 years of age just because they are fingerprinted for their first identity card .
I still remember that it was a major event in my youth to get my own identity card .
Nevertheless , I recognise this is a very sensitive question .
Consequently , the Commission believes it should clarify to Parliament two very strict and clear ideas .
First , we should not ask Eurodac to give answers that Eurodac cannot give .
We will come to Parliament and the Council with proposals in the next few months .
We have just achieved , this week , a working document to re-evaluate the Dublin Convention itself .
We want to launch a debate not only on the technical questions of Eurodac but also on the essential solutions to the current Dublin Convention .
We do not want to lose time .
We want to have as broad a picture as possible for all instruments that concern asylum policy .
Where is the point of difference between the Commission and the Council ?
Of course , the Council has been generous in the sense that it has given to the Commission management and the technical functioning of the system .
But there is a point where the Commission does not agree with the Council .
We do not agree that the Council should reserve for itself the powers of implementation of the system .
According to the comitology agreement , there are not sufficient grounds for the Council to reserve the implementing powers for itself rather than delegating them to the Commission .
The proposal of the Commission is that the executive powers , the implementing powers of the system , should be delegated to the Commission , associated with a committee composed of representatives from all Member States .
In our opinion this will be a more coherent and transparent way of managing the system and reinforcing the capability of Parliament to scrutinise the way the Commission manages and develops the Eurodac system .
Maybe through this balanced solution it will be possible to address in a more relaxed and trusting way some of the reservations and political doubts that have been raised by several Members of Parliament during this debate .
Maybe I am being stubborn but this is what I sincerely believe .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
Trade in bovine animals and pigs
Mr President , the point of this report is to allow the situation which prevailed before 1 July 1999 to be reinstated with regard to a provision which has been in force since 1 July 1999 .
The reasons given by the Commission are as follows : the Member States have failed to honour their undertaking to implement a control system and we therefore need to reinstate temporarily the situation which prevailed previously .
Nonetheless , we support the Commission ' s proposal because we consider that the old rules provide a sufficient degree of safety , especially as the Commission is only asking for one year ' s delay .
What you should have done , Commissioner Byrne , was to apply directly for four years , if it was going to take four years , especially as this would have given a sign to the Member States .
If the Commission is leaving itself an escape clause in the form of a three-year postponement , why should we keep to our side of the bargain ?
However , here too we said that we wanted to help out .
We tabled a proposed amendment seeking to reduce this period to two years and it became clear during discussions with the Commission that it too was willing to go along with this proposed amendment .
In the codecision procedure , Article 8 applies under the decision on comitology but not under Article 37 .
We take the view that these two separate submissions are unnecessary and we have tabled a single proposed amendment which I shall read to you .
We are calling for Article 17a to be deleted .
I hope that the Commission is able to accept this amendment .
This is a codecision process .
If the Commission and the Council are able to adopt our amendments , we can shorten the procedure which , given that we have been in a legal grey area since 1 July 1999 , is a reasonable step .
We have already had intensive discussions .
I am curious to see what the outcome of your position will be .
I hope that you will go along with our considerations , as tabled during the discussions , especially as we do not disagree in principle .
Mr President , we are dealing here with amendments to a directive concerning the intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine .
I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his report and agreeing very strongly with the remarks he has just made .
In the case of the pig sector the export trade is also suffering because during the past two years the pig industry has experienced acute difficulties .
Indeed in Scotland , my own country , we have witnessed a 25 % reduction in the national herd in the past twelve months .
Unless urgent action is taken by the UK Government , a further 25 % will go within the next few months .
These factors are driving UK pig farmers out of business as more and more cheap imports are sourced by retailers and supermarkets in the UK .
Now it transpires that the situation could deteriorate even further as EU applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe are projected to increase their net exports of pigmeat by nearly 300 % by the year 2006 .
If Britain is once again to reactivate a dynamic intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine , then immediate help is required to alleviate the catastrophic situation affecting rural Britain and affecting our pig and beef sectors in particular .
I hope this message is getting through to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer .
Mr President , I also agree with the rapporteur with regard to the basic matters and I can naturally and gladly sympathise with the amendment calling for the transition period to be just two years .
This is a case of negligence on the part of the Member States in putting these matters and the system into effect .
Mr Stevenson mentioned that exports from East Europe are increasing : we are now expanding the area of the EU to include the countries of Eastern Europe .
If our own systems are not in order , how can we expect new Member States to be able to be ready to join our system of agricultural policy ?
For that reason we will have to pay very serious attention in the future to ensuring that Member States really do adopt systems we are here taking joint decisions on .
If that is not the case , there will have to be some form of sanction to ensure these matters are put right .
Mr President , I would like to join previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur .
He has approached this matter with his usual conviction and great dedication .
I was very pleased to hear him say that there is no real conflict on the principles and objectives of the proposed directive .
I have no doubt that the Commissioner will assist in reaching a satisfactory resolution because both Parliament and the Commission have a common goal in relation to this very important and very crucial area .
In this regard , I support proposals for a further update of the 1997 directive with the caution that it must be done in a sensible way .
We need to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy while , at the same time , providing total traceability with regard to livestock movement as well as safeguarding public health .
Mr President , this proposal introduces an extension of a current exemption to Directive 64 / 432 applicable to the Spanish Government .
Without this exemption , it would be required to implement a system of veterinary checks for tuberculosis and brucellosis , for each bovine animal exported from its region .
These are already , of course , implemented by many other states .
This exemption has important implications for my country .
Whilst Spain is being given exemption , the British meat industry is suffering heavily from the implementation of an allied directive which requires ruinously expensive veterinary checks in our slaughterhouses .
So rigorous are the requirements for veterinary supervision that we do not have enough British vets to carry out the work .
But instead of giving us more time , the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings .
In order to avoid ending up in the European Court of Justice , my government has had to recruit large numbers of EU vets , 300 of whom come from Spain .
It does not seem right to me that British slaughterhouses should be put through the hoops as a result of the Commission 's action whilst Spain is allowed to default on its obligations .
Why is the Commission giving Spain such an easy time ?
On that basis , I believe that this proposed directive is wrong and I will be voting against it .
Under EU trading rules and in the interest of food safety and consumer confidence in animal health status , annual testing is required to maintain the official TB-free status of our cattle herds .
With a cattle population in Ireland of between 7 and 8 million in recent years , some 10.5 million TB tests have been undertaken annually in some 138 000 herds .
Since 1954 , when our TB scheme was introduced , we have spent in Ireland - a small country - EUR 2.54 billion on TB testing and subsequently brucellosis testing .
I think that stands as a testament to our determination to protect the health status of our cattle herds in Ireland .
Indeed , following disclosure of a reaction , a special contiguous testing programme for herds adjoining restricted herds is operated .
Analysis of test data is carried out on an on-going basis by a special TB investigation unit .
Routine post-mortem examinations are carried out by veterinary surgeons employed by the Department on all animals slaughtered .
Animals which react positively to the TB test are slaughtered .
From the earliest stages in the bovine TB eradication scheme , the Department of Agriculture has recognised the benefit of pre-movement testing , and we request that our particular amendment to the amending directive be looked on favourably .
I understand considerable work has been done on laboratory-based blood tests for TB .
The gamma-interferon test is the most promising of these , and is used under practical field conditions as an adjunct to the tuberculin test in herds .
I would like the Commissioner to indicate where that now stands and how quickly we will be able to have a blood test accepted by the EU .
The TB test we use now is herd-specific , not animal-specific .
We need to get to the stage where blood tests for individual animals will stand up .
Mr President , Commissioner , animal epidemics are not only important economic matters , they are also important from the point of view of consumer policy .
Plus , animal epidemics are again costing us a great deal of money .
The main objective of the directive is to create electronic data bases from which information on bovine animals and pigs , and how they are kept , can be accessed , in order to foster safety and transparency .
These new data bases will form part of the bovine animal labelling and registration system set out in the regulation .
I agree with the rapporteur that Member States are always very slow to implement unwelcome Community legislation , which is why we need to discuss if a 3-year margin is really sensible .
I think that Mr Daul ' s proposed amendment of two years would be an excellent compromise .
I should also like to point out in this connection that , rather than planting more trees , we need to clear the jungle of paragraphs and exemptions .
Absolute account must be taken of the Economic and Social Committee ' s reservations concerning strict limits on exemptions and harmonisation of veterinary legislation .
I therefore fail to understand that some countries are doing their homework while others keep finding excuses and dragging their feet .
All that does is distort competition and , for this reason , I vote that we make the regulation binding on everyone as quickly as possible .
Mr President , I will try to be brief , and I will not use all the time available to me but restrict myself to a short message .
This morning , in this Chamber , one of the Members made the statement that without rules there is no freedom . But I feel that where there are too many rules , freedom can become confusion .
It is my opinion that this measure is suffering from a surfeit of rules . Since 1964 , a series of laws have been adopted on this subject .
Some were implemented , but many were not . The application of some of them was deferred , and others were not adapted by the individual States .
It is very likely that this is caused by difficulties in implementing the directives .
The delays in the adaptation of national legislation may well be due to the expense and tedium involved , as well as the fact that the process is often unproductive .
Mr President , may I first of all thank you for the interest you have devoted to the Commission proposal modifying Directive 64 / 432 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine .
Member States encountered serious trade problems when implementing the updated animal health rules for intra-Community trade laid down in Directive 64 / 432 that came into force on 1 July last year .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament agreed on two amendments tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf to the Commission proposal .
The first amendment requires the Member States to ensure full implementation of the directive and the Member States and the Commission to execute controls on the implementation .
The second amendment seeks to restrict the period of application of transitional measures to two years .
The Commission can agree to these Amendments Nos 1 and 2 and must therefore oppose the amendment from Mrs Auroi requesting the deletion of any transitional measures .
However , I regret that I am not in a position to accept written Amendment No 3 which Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf put forward last week .
It modifies the comitology procedure by proposing for implementing measures relating to Article 37 to introduce a management procedure with the right of scrutiny .
But I understand that perhaps Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf may very well have misinterpreted the comitology and that he intends to amend it again during this plenary .
Let me express my surprise and concern about this .
I regret that I cannot accept your new amendment which replaces Article 17 and 17a by a single new article comprising the entire comitology procedure .
I can assure you of the importance that I attach to Parliament 's role in the legislative process , in particular relating to comitology in the codecision procedure .
The overall aim is to achieve quick and efficient results in order to translate policy into legislative acts .
The framework for the comitology procedure is clearly established in the abovementioned Council decision .
The right of scrutiny for the Parliament is foreseen for areas relating to codecision , that is Article 8 .
The amended Directive 64 / 432 is based on Articles 37 and 152 of the Treaty .
The new provision concerning the implementing powers for the Commission to lay down transitional measures may have a direct effect on public health .
This is the reason why the Commission , in this case , proposes Article 17a which refers to a regulatory committee with the right of scrutiny for Parliament .
That is , and I am advised by the legal service , the appropriate way to deal with this .
In any situation where a basic legislative provision envisages amendment by a comitology procedure it must include in the basic provision the actual procedure for the comitology .
That is why each individual provision which envisages such an amendment must identify the procedure quite clearly .
Therefore these measures should not be subject to the right of scrutiny of Parliament .
I will now make some remarks on the implications of the proposed amendment for the institutional balance .
This system aims clearly at defining exactly the respective role of the executive and legislative power in the basic legislative instrument .
The procedure must be made clear in the basic legislative provision requiring to be amended by comitology .
Any wording leaving room for case-by-case negotiation would jeopardise the delicate institutional balance and also seriously undermine transparency .
I note from the document that Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has circulated this afternoon where he signals his intention to put forward this amendment at this stage .
Let me assure Parliament that it is not my intention , in setting out these two procedures - Articles 17 and 17a - to ensure that the European Parliament does not ask for rights that it does not have .
I am firmly committed to the procedure of codecision and I am firmly committed to the procedures laid down in comitology .
I am firmly committed to the notion that Parliament will have full scrutiny of Commission proposals in circumstances where the legal structures of the European Union , that is the Treaty and the directive , allow for that situation .
To deviate from that is to risk challenge in the European Court , which is something that I must avoid .
Also I must reply to Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf by saying that the two , as he describes , almost identical references to comitology procedure are not in fact identical .
They are quite different and must be dealt with quite separately .
However , it is in the interest of all the institutions that the procedures are clearly defined and transparent for everybody .
Furthermore , adopting this amendment would mean further delaying the legislative procedure which could otherwise be concluded after the first reading .
In conclusion I wish to confirm that I accept Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf 's Amendments Nos 1 and 2 but not the amendment on the comitology procedure that he has suggested this afternoon .
Consequently I cannot accept the amendment of Mrs Auroi either .
You are , of course , quite correct in relation to that .
That agreement , however , was reached with the Council subsequent to the initial drafting of this document .
That is why it has been drafted in this way .
It pre-dates that agreement .
It will be automatically amended in the manner envisaged in the agreement with the Council .
Therefore the concerns that you have in relation to this matter will be remedied automatically in accordance with that agreement .
You also suggested that if the Commission goes along with your suggestion that there will be a shortened procedure .
I have made it clear that I am prepared to respond quickly to any invitation that the committee might wish to extend to me to discuss this important constitutional issue of the interaction between Article 37 and Article 152 .
Mr President , allow me to ask Commissioner Byrne one more question .
The situation is this : you tabled a text which no longer complies with the standard procedure agreed with the Council .
We noticed that .
We then table our proposed amendments , which you consider to be correct as far as principle and procedure are concerned .
Of course , we too consulted our legal service and the text which I read out to you contains precisely this reference to comitology .
The legal text is therefore confirmed .
The Commission is being thick-skinned here ; it is saying no , we stand by our proposal as we have already done on a similar occasion in the past here in Parliament .
Then we can use the simplified procedure .
Generosity is incumbent upon the Commission , not the rapporteur .
It makes no sense to continue with the debate .
I would ask the Commissioner to reply as briefly as possible .
I am afraid that what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has said discloses a misunderstanding of the issue .
That gives clarity to the situation . It avoids any exercise of discretion by the Commission or anybody else .
It leaves it clear to anybody reading the text what the appropriate procedure is that will govern this particular situation .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The relevant committee will continue the discussion of this issue .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0201 / 2000 ) .
We will examine questions to the Council .
The President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Seixas da Costa , is here with us today .
He has to leave the chamber at 7.00 p.m. and we must therefore try to be very quick and make a collective effort so that we can deal with the majority of the questions .
Question No 1 by ( H-0141 / 00 ) :
During the proceedings , the Swiss Foreign Minister , Mrs Ruth Dreifuss , stated that 300 000 women were victims of trafficking in Europe .
Does the Council concur with that statement ?
Does it consider that the measures it is taking are sufficient to guarantee the safety and dignity of women in Europe in the face of the threat of trafficking ?
What additional measures will it take to counteract a probable deterioration in the situation arising from enlargement , given that the majority of victims are from countries applying for membership of the Union ?
.
Since the adoption of that platform , the European institutions and the Member States have been working hard to ensure that it is applied both at national and European Union level .
Firstly , starting in November 1993 , the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed a series of recommendations on trade in human beings for prostitution , with a view to combating trafficking in human beings .
Two years after that , this House took on this subject : apart from adopting a number of resolutions , it also produced a report and a resolution which specifically addressed trafficking in human beings .
The importance of this programme should not be underestimated , given that it has helped to finance a great many projects and has proved to be genuinely effective .
A number of conclusions emerged from this work .
Lastly , also in 1996 , the Council approved a common action to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children .
In 1997 , the Ministerial Conference in The Hague resulted in The Hague Ministerial declaration on a European Code of Conduct to prevent and combat trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation .
Lastly , in 1998 , the Commission adopted a further communication on new measures to combat trafficking in women .
We believe that it is increasingly important to exchange views with other destination countries so as to make a comparative assessment of this phenomenon and to establish a series of harmonised measures for controlling it .
Campaigns are being financed under the PHARE programme in this field , some with support from the International Organisation for Migration .
I would like to make it clear that the Council does not wish to comment on the figure of 300 000 women falling victim to trafficking in Europe given by the Swiss Foreign Minister .
This is why this question needs to be tackled at the highest level , and in particular in conjunction with the United Nations .
To this end , the Council recently adopted a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate on this very protocol .
The Member States of the European Union are also playing a very active role in the meeting of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women which is preparing the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on women .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am truly grateful for your full answer to this question on the programmes which , as you have pointed out , have been implemented .
While adding my thanks to the Council for the earlier answer , I would like to press the Council on a related matter .
Furthermore , the BBC alleged that this was being done with the tacit approval of the Romanian authorities because it was bringing hard currency into Romania .
Will the Council raise this in their dialogue with Romania in relation to Romania 's application for membership of the Community ?
I would like to thank you for your question , Mr Martin , as it gives me an opportunity to discuss an initiative recently taken by the Portuguese presidency in Romania .
I had an opportunity to exchange impressions with the Romanian authorities on this subject less than 10 days ago , and not just on the subject of trafficking in children , but also on the problems of the Roma .
These are issues that the Romanian authorities say they are taking very seriously and , as far as I could ascertain , they consider that they stem from a cultural situation affecting certain sections of the population .
I detected a great commitment by the Romanian authorities to going as far as possible to confront situations of this kind .
Question No 2 by ( H-0148 / 00 ) :
Can the Council rule out the possibility that the facts outlined above constitute serious and persistent violations of fundamental rights as defined in Article 6 of the TEU and , if so , for what reasons ?
If not , does it intend to launch the procedures referred to in Article 7 ?
Mr President , this question has already been broached here more than once .
And this action may lead to the suspension of this Member State ' s rights as a member of the European Union .
I have to say that the facts that Mr Dupuis refers to in his question do not represent a violation of any of the principles mentioned in Article 6 of the Treaty .
This article should not be invoked with a view to any type of interference in the administration of the home affairs of Member States , particular in the field of justice .
They do not bind the Council and they do not affect the free and normal functioning of the Community institutions , in which Austria is still participating in full .
Mr President-in-Office , I think that you have clarified the technical aspects of Articles 6 and 7 very fully indeed .
We still have an almost purely national framework for justice , although certain situations are in practice clearly of a transnational nature .
My question relates to the ad hoc decision by the Prime Minister concerning bilateral sanctions taken without consulting the foreign secretaries of the governments and parliaments of the states of Europe .
All the European Union institutions were bypassed and presented with a fait accompli .
Hence my question : what will happen in the future if we disregard the case of Austria now ?
Will the national Prime Ministers of the countries of Europe pass judgement in future ?
Will a majority of eight votes suffice or will a different majority be needed ?
In what way do the European Council and the European institutions lose power and the potential to formulate policy as a result ?
Is this a question of new competition between the European institutions and the national states ?
As for your question about Austria , I would like to repeat what I said about Austria ' s compliance with Articles 6 and 7 up to now .
What was at issue was not the Austrian Government ' s conduct , but its political make-up .
During an earlier debate I said that we are now all Austrians within the European Union , and I would like to repeat that .
We are all Austrians because the European Union is a single entity in terms of rights and citizenship , and I would like to have the same rights in Austria that Austrian citizens should have in my country .
And , as I said , this would be a purely bilateral matter .
The Austrians have every right to whatever government they want - but we have every right to our opinions about the Austrian Government .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you said that there is a party in power in Austria which has made racist comments in public .
Here in the European Parliament , people speak , not parties .
In your reply to Mr Dupuis ' question , you referred to the fact that the sanctions approved by the Heads of State and Governments of fourteen countries were bilateral in nature .
Can these sanctions also be stopped bilaterally ? In other words , can an individual Member State decide to end the sanctions and resume normal working relations ?
If so , when will the Council officially release the citizens of Austria from this ordeal , which violates their democratic rights ?
Must each Member State individually abandon the sanctions before the Council comes to its senses and overturns the decision ?
I think Mrs Kauppi must have misheard or there must have been a mistake in the interpreting .
I never said that the Austrian Government is a racist government , let me make that quite clear .
And the Freedom Party has not as yet made any statement totally repudiating its association with ideologies of this kind .
As for the other question you have raised , the answer is yes .
Any country can disassociate itself from the declaration made by the 14 countries .
The same freedom that led them to stand together could lead them to part company tomorrow if they had a different view of developments in Austria .
You also asked , Mrs Kauppi , when the Council will allow the Austrian people to escape from this pressure .
First of all , there is no Council decision .
As I have already said , we are talking about 14 countries .
This is not a European Union issue .
I would like to make it clear that Austria has been totally involved and will continue to be one hundred per cent involved in all the formal workings of the European Union ' s institutions .
Different individuals will have different perceptions of all this .
I personally do not like sitting alongside fascists .
Question No 3 by ( H-0151 / 00 ) :
In some cases , the fuel shortage has claimed human lives .
This programme started with two local authorities where the opposition held power .
The European Union subsequently decided , acting on proposals from various Member States , to extend this system to five other municipalities .
We hope that this signal from the European Union will be heard by democratic forces in Serbia .
We are aware that this obviously has an impact on the civilian population .
We are witnessing what I see as speedy preparation for a new bout in the dirty war against Yugoslavia and its people and everything going on outside Kosovo over the last few days bears witness to this .
The point is whether or not a country has the right to decide its fate and choose its government .
In Yugoslavia , the people decided democratically and Yugoslavia has its government and its president .
And whether we like it or not , that is a fact .
What sort of logic is it which , in order to punish the supposed suppressor of a people , punishes his supposed victims ?
Mr President , that is what is being done with the barbaric bombing , that is what is being done with the fuel embargo on Yugoslavia .
We are supporting a policy of genocide against a people which does not accept the choices foisted on it by the USA , NATO and the European Union .
My question is this : because there have already been a great many deaths due to the cold , will the fuel embargo be lifted and will the Yugoslav people be left to decide its own fate ?
I totally accept the honourable Member ' s premise that every people needs to be the master of its own destiny , that is exactly what we are seeking .
If that is what Mr Korakas thinks exists in Serbia , then we know where we stand .
Question No 4 by ( H-0155 / 00 ) :
Has it attempted to obtain this information and , if so , will it forward it to the author of this question and to the European Parliament ?
What action does it intend to take to remedy this lack of information ?
This cooperation between the missions of Member States will also cover information sharing on citizens who may be threatened with the death penalty .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am grateful for your words but not for their content .
In other words , I appreciate your concern but not the content of the information you have offered .
This cannot be due to lack of time because I asked this question to the Council three months ago and it did not reply in writing .
It did not reply within the time period laid down and is replying now , orally , two months late .
Do you not think that this is rather difficult for the European citizens to understand ?
I know that we require the commitment of the Member States , but do you not think that what we basically need is a political will which , until now , I have not seen from any quarter ?
Mrs Díez González , you have asked two questions . The first concerns the reply and the time the Council has taken to provide it .
As you know , this is a procedural matter and involves deadlines set unilaterally by the European Parliament .
The Council was not involved in approving those deadlines , has never accepted them , and it is accordingly the Council ' s policy to reiterate this point on a regular basis .
With regard to the specific point you are making , I recognise that you are perfectly right and that this is an issue which should be included in the agenda for work in this area as soon as possible .
Your comments make perfect sense .
You will also be aware that consular cooperation within the European Union is a recent development .
A systematic approach for consular cooperation and for coordinated consular action has only been developed in the last few years .
I presume that there are delays , and I believe that you are quite right , and the pressure being brought to bear on the Council on this subject is welcome as far as I am concerned .
It is a challenge which has still to be met , but I understand what was meant by that comment .
Question No 5 by ( H-0158 / 00 ) :
It is for the Council to respect and apply the relevant provisions of the Euratom Treaty , which does not provide for the Parliament to be consulted on these matters , which is how the Treaties stand .
In my role as chairman of the preparatory group for the ICG , I will make sure to take account of this request regarding the ICG .
However , no non-member country has made use of this facility to date .
Furthermore , the legal basis for this is the Euratom Treaty , so that there is once again no provision for consulting the European Parliament .
Thank you , Minister .
So do you have a feeling about how these discussions may develop in the IGC ?
Nevertheless , we will continue to maintain a dialogue with the European Parliament on this subject .
Question No 6 by ( H-0160 / 00 ) :
Repayment of a loan which Germany extracted from the Bank of Greece during the occupation in 1943 also remains outstanding .
I can answer the honourable Member ' s question quite easily : this issue does not fall within the competencies of the Council .
It is a matter for bilateral relations between Greece and German and the Council is not , therefore , willing to take any action , let alone the action recommended by the honourable Member .
Mr President , the reply by the President-in-Office puts me in mind of the reply by Pontius Pilate .
How exactly do things stand ?
During the occupation , the German Government forced the Greek Government to give it a loan , which today , with interest and inflation , totals some USD 25 billion .
This loan was signed and sealed and represents an obligation .
It collects every last cent of the loans which it grants .
The other issue is the tremendous damage caused by Germany ' s occupying forces in Greece .
This comes to some USD 40 billion .
Other countries have been paid . Greece has not .
Why ?
Of course , the Greek Governments bear some responsibility , but at some point all this needs to be analysed .
Germany has acknowledged its obligation from time to time . However , it has failed to honour it on various pretexts .
Now there are no longer any excuses and it is duty-bound to pay and the Council cannot wash its hands .
I consider the reply by the President-in-Office to be unacceptable .
I can assure Mr Korakas that the Council is perfectly willing to intervene in this matter , as long as he can explain to us what the legal basis for doing so would be , under the Treaties .
Question No 7 by ( H-0162 / 00 ) :
Subject : Support for European films European films are highly important to the cultural diversity and the cultural heritage both of the individual countries and of Europe .
80 to 90 % of the films showing in Sweden are , however , American .
Up to 50 % state aid for film production is allowed in the EU at present .
The Commission is said to be considering lowering the limit for State aid , i.e. to reduce the exemption for cultural support to a maximum of 30 % .
This would be a threat to European film production , as producing films is expensive and commercially very risky , especially in smaller countries .
Does the Council agree that State aid is important to promote European culture ?
Does the Council not consider it important to encourage diversed European film production ?
Mr President , Mrs Hedkvist Petersen ' s question is a very important one , but we do not have any information to the effect that the Commission is considering reducing state aids in this field .
In fact , the Council understands that as part of its programme , the Commission is holding discussions with Member States on this very subject .
I would like to explain that at national level this type of support is a matter for Member States , within certain legal limits laid down in the Treaty .
On the other hand , the existing MEDIA II programme and the future MEDIA-PLUS programme provide complementary financial assistance with a view to strengthening the presence of European cinema .
I would like to thank the Council 's representative for his reply .
Firstly , I would like to say that there is an enormous difference between , for example , producing cars or lorries and producing a film .
We are aware that film production is dependent on aid , as it is a combination of culture and commercial production .
We also know that European film , particularly when produced in languages with few speakers , cannot easily maintain as large a film production as one would wish .
Therefore , aid for both national and European film production is extremely important , as is the opportunity to continue the practice of accepting up to 50 percent State aid for film production .
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen , I am of course especially conscious of the point you have made about the Union ' s smaller Member States .
We are also concerned about this .
At the moment we have no indication that the Commission is considering a lowering of this limit , let alone the amount and the percentage mentioned by the honourable Member .
Question No 8 by ( H-0166 / 00 ) :
Subject : Information for the public Will the Council draw up a list of parties which the electorate can safely vote for without running the risk of their country being ostracised ?
If we went down that path we would certainly be entering very dangerous territory .
This means that it cannot be accepted as a legitimate party in the democratic process . Other countries have different systems and these have just as many virtues as my own .
We are all European citizens and we are all citizens of a European Union which is underpinned , politically speaking , by a basic set of principles .
If these principles are at risk , we have the right - and the duty - to sound the alarm .
But whether lists of parties are desirable or otherwise , I hope that this never becomes a matter for the European Union .
Yes , but the problem , of course , is that this is what we are concerned with here .
Up until now , it is only opinions you are punishing and not actions .
If it were a question of actions , it would perhaps be Denmark which should be punished for a ban on immigrants of a kind which the FPÖ has not been able to put into practice .
It is therefore opinions which you have punished and not actions .
Knowing the answer to these questions would be useful as a guide to the consumer , but it may well be that the action taken by the 14 Prime Ministers is a source of regret .
The attitude adopted by some Member States towards the Austrian Government related to their negative perception of the new Austrian Government , which does not affect the Community framework .
We are not working at Council level here .
The European Union has not taken a single discriminatory measure against Austria .
However , Mr Bonde , you should not , of course , confuse economic and monetary union with Nazism , they are in fact slightly different .
Of course , all parties have every right to oppose economic and monetary union , the Schengen Agreement , or anything else ; they can even oppose the European Union itself .
As you know , there are parties which are opposed to the European Union , but that does not mean that they should be seen as undemocratic .
It is therefore quite natural , Mr Bonde , that certain governments should feel somewhat uneasy .
This uneasiness is only being reflected in bilateral relations .
We are not confusing Community matters with bilateral matters .
Question No 9 by ( H-0169 / 00 ) :
I have received no letter from the President-in-Office , which confirms my worst suspicions about the obsessive secretiveness of the Council .
In the case of definitive legislative acts approved by the Council , the reports include the results of any votes , and any statements for the minutes made by the Council , the Commission and the Member States .
This is in fact one of the achievements of the much maligned Treaty of Amsterdam which people need to be regularly reminded about .
After each meeting of the Council , a press release is issued which contains information on decisions taken by the Council .
This indicates for which decisions statements for the minutes were authorised for release to the public and which are obtainable from the Press Service .
It is also possible to obtain information on the legislative transparency of the Council by e-mail .
These provisions need to reflect a number of concerns which , whilst preserving the rules of transparency , cannot be allowed to turn transparency into a means of making any Council activity totally ineffective .
For this reason , as I have already said , this article stipulates that the rules of procedure of the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission should contain specific provisions regarding access to their documents .
During the Finnish presidency , substantial progress was made in the field of access to documents by means of modern information technology , and in particular the Internet .
Furthermore , a Council Decision on improving the provision of information relating to the Council 's legislative activities and the public register of Council documents was approved .
The current presidency has been following this practice .
The presidency immediately initiated discussion of the proposal , which was presented at the Coreper meeting on 2 February and which was examined at two subsequent meetings .
This set of tasks has therefore , Mr President , been developed by the Council on the basis of Commission proposals which I believe suggest a real will to increase the transparency of this work .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for a very long , detailed and serious reply .
Because I do not speak Portuguese I shall study the reply before the next question time and come back to you on it in April .
For now I would like you to give me a very simple reply to a very simple question of principle .
I do not think it is the case in the Council that the public is actually able to see and hear everything that their representatives say and do when passing laws .
Would you accept that principle ?
Discussion of legislative proposals within the government is not in the public domain , but the result of these legislative proposals is in the public domain , whether they come before parliament or not .
Mr President , during the Finnish presidency , we were able to get through twenty questions in question time .
Last time we covered twelve with Portugal as the country holding the presidency .
It seems as if we will not get through any more than that today either .
. ( PT ) I have two points to make , Mr Seppänen .
Firstly , if that was how Parliament saw things , we could even give not twenty , but thirty answers to honourable Members ' questions .
But we can also opt for a bureaucratic , officious , quick , artificial and probably unsatisfactory answer .
We would then - in quantitative terms - be more successful in giving answers to this House .
I have been here since 9 o ' clock in the morning and I do not think that the Council can be accused of not doing a serious job in answering honourable Members ' questions .
I would be grateful if you could rephrase your question , Mr Nicholson , because I did not grasp what you were saying .
Excuse me , but could you put the question in a different way ?
You were saying that the Council is not alone in being a legislature that makes its decisions in secret .
I just wondered if you could give us examples of other similar organisations in government that make these decisions in the same way .
Unless I am very much mistaken , Mr Nicholson , the majority of governments do not broadcast meetings at which they are acting in their legislative capacity .
Governments ' legislative role is normally exercised in restricted , closed meetings in every country in the world .
Therefore , to the best of my knowledge , in the majority of countries throughout the world , governments do their work in closed sessions not open to the public .
Mr Seixas da Costa had informed us that he had to leave at 7.00 p.m.
He has also pointed out that he has been working with us since 9.00 a.m.
I believe that today he has earned his salary as a minister and as President-in-Office of the Council .
We will therefore conclude questions to the Council and thank him for being here .
Questions Nos 10 to 38 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes Questions to the Council .
( The sitting was closed at 7.00 p.m. )
Mr Evans has the floor .
Evans , Robert ( PSE ) .
Mr President , my point of order relates to Rules 148 and 135 regarding the distribution of the minutes and particularly regarding roll-call votes .
All Members have , this morning , received a booklet containing 113 pages of roll-call votes .
I am sure this is of interest to a number of Members and there will be a few Members who want to look at it .
But in the interests of economy and the environment , I would suggest that Parliament look again , or ask Parliament 's services to look again , at the interpretation of the word ' distribution ' .
I wonder if you could ask the services to have another look at this please , President .
Thank you , Mr Evans .
Your comments will be passed on , not to the services , of course , but to the Bureau .
If you were also to add the cost of each of those votes to Parliament ' s budget , there would be even more cause for concern .
EU-Mexico Interim Agreement
In May 1998 Parliament gave its assent to a provisional interim agreement on trade and related issues associated with the 1997 agreement .
Here I want to thank the Commission for making this consultation by the Council possible in close cooperation with Parliament - I am delighted about that and I hope it will set a precedent .
However , I am sorry it did not adopt the commitment of the previous Commission to keep us informed of the progress of the negotiations , given the importance of the issues involved .
In fact , Article 1 of that agreement makes respect for democratic principles and human rights , in the widest sense , an essential factor and the very foundation of the agreement .
All the same , in spite of this asymmetry , Community producers will clearly be in a much better position to compete in the Mexican market than they have been up to now .
Mr President , I should like to start by thanking Mrs Ferrer for her excellent report .
She has gone to a great deal of trouble and has used her report to set out the problems and the advantages and disadvantages of this project with Mexico .
This is a trade agreement which falls within the competence of the EU and , as you rightly say , we only have the option of saying yes or no .
We cannot renegotiate the agreement .
All in all , our Group will vote in favour of this trade agreement , which we welcome .
For the rest , I should like to say to Mr Folias , who worries about the problem of footwear that , generally-speaking , trade relations between Europe and Mexico have always proven their worth in the past .
We might have been able to dispense with the Lannoye report on chocolate yesterday had Mexico not given us cocoa in the past .
In fact , chocolate - " chocolatl " - is a Mexican word .
We can therefore use past experience to help develop future relations with Mexico .
The advantage to Mexico is obvious .
This agreement will enable Mexico to redress the imbalance of its one-way dependence on the USA to a certain extent .
I should like to remind the House that 85 % of Mexico ' s exports go north and only 5 % come to Europe .
Mexico stands to gain here by achieving a better trade equilibrium .
Mexico ' s automobile industry , which is partly of European origin , certainly also stands to gain from the possibility of exporting vehicles to Europe .
We too stand to gain , as does European industry , be it on the Mexican market or by exporting to the USA via the Mexican market .
As far as trade is concerned , there are advantages all round .
I should like to go briefly into , or at least touch on , two problems .
The first are social problems ; in other words , Mexico will certainly have to review its social policy because trade policies alone will not solve social problems .
When free trade increases , there are also losers .
Poverty in Mexico has risen rather than fallen .
Social policy is therefore an important area for Mexico and we should build this into the dialogue with Mexico .
The second is scientific and technical cooperation .
I think that there is potential here which can be exploited between Europe and Mexico .
There have been certain changes in Mexico recently , since the announcement and approval of the agreement , largely in a positive direction .
If that does not happen , there is a risk that this very significant agreement will not be worth the paper it is written on .
Both we and the people of Mexico set great store by this agreement .
They see it as a chance to correct their one-way dependence on NAFTA .
They believe that , in the EU , they have found a partner which stands for democracy , human rights and social and ecological development .
Today we have analysed the contract and found that the agreement with the EU not only creates the same sort of relationship as with NAFTA , but that , in parts , it is even worse .
Like the rightly failed MAI , freedom of investment , reproduced bilaterally , does nothing to foster a democratically-controlled economy geared to local development .
Placing no limit on opening public procurement merely allows large suppliers to swallow up small suppliers all over the world .
Provisions such as domestic treatment and bans on conditions cut companies which , for example , prefer to employ women or engage in environmentally sound production , out of the running .
The EU has kept derogations open for itself here .
Mexico has none !
Here is another shortcoming in comparison with NAFTA : the latter has an agreement on employees ' rights with a sanction mechanism , while the EU agreement has not even heard of the Social Pact of the United Nations .
However , the opposite applies to trade disputes , for which a dispute settlement mechanism is provided together with the possibility of sanctions .
We know from the WTO that environmental laws are regularly sidelined as the result of such disputes .
" A free trade agreement at the cost of the Mexicans " .
It was under this banner that the Mexican civil society called a few days ago for the Senate to improve the agreement and not to rush into signing it .
Some points even contradict the Mexican constitution .
" We are not ' globalphobes ' they write at the end , " but we want globalisation which benefits mankind and a fair world order without social exclusion " .
We here in the European Parliament do not oppose an agreement with Mexico .
On the contrary !
We are unable , however , to vote in favour of this agreement for the reasons stated and must continue to fight for better agreements in the future .
One last word : we need a critical voice here in Parliament which continues to support the rightful concerns and demands of Mexican society .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Ferrer , for the recommendation on the implementation of certain articles of the EC-Mexico Interim Agreement on trade .
The report is thorough , but I am afraid that I do not agree with the choices and recommendations it makes , although we do welcome some of the criticisms mentioned .
However , these criticisms are decisive , and have led us to oppose the motion .
We are particularly concerned by the fact that the rapporteur is satisfied with the progress made by Mexico in the area of human rights and democracy since the application of the global agreement .
At the same time , the Saint Andrés agreements and the rights of the indigenous peasants are not being observed .
All this is common knowledge and I need say no more .
The EU-Mexico Agreement could have negative implications if it does not take into account the need for balanced development , and not uncontrolled liberalisation , which could lead to greater poverty and inequality .
Mr President , we regard the title of the agreement which is the subject of Mrs Ferrer ' s report as at best incomplete , at worst dissembling .
That is a totally unrealistic objective for the near future and it is quite obvious for whose benefit the measures advocated in the text are designed .
Indeed , it must be quite clear to everyone that the decline in European exports to Mexico is the result of the NAFTA agreement , which turns the entire area into a single free trade area .
Under these conditions , how can anyone justify the fact that the respective markets will be liberalised at different rates , to the detriment of the Europeans ?
So , all in all , the on-going agreement has not allowed Mexico to protect vulnerable labour , intensive sectors and minimal environmental standards .
Fortunately , that criticism and reluctance is now a thing of the past ; unfortunately , however , we still hear some reservations , like those voiced in Parliament just now .
I think we need to realise that what we are doing is actually forestalling the fears expressed here , with an agreement which , in this case , is purely about trade .
So we are forestalling these fears about Europe losing ground in Mexico against the exporting power of the United States .
What is more , this agreement means we are also strengthening the country ' s democratisation process .
As a result of that 500 year-old meeting of civilisations , Mexico is a country culturally and politically bound to Europe .
But politically and geo-politically , the fundamental weight has essentially lain with the United States , its powerful neighbour to the North .
And until these agreements start to bite , the hegemony of the United States in terms of economics , trade and investment will remain virtually absolute .
But Mexico has also made great progress on human rights .
It has been granted permanent observer status at the OECD and in 1999 it reformed its constitution to grant autonomy to its National Commission on Human Rights
So , for both economic and political reasons , we urge approval of this agreement .
Mr President , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance does not have a common position on this issue .
Obviously we share a basic concern about everything relating to human rights and sustainable development , especially in a context which leaves no room for social exclusion .
I also think measures can be introduced to monitor its effects at all levels , not just on tariff changes and so on .
So let us do all that and let us be vigilant about preventing what we want to prevent : the continued violation of human rights .
Mr President , first I want to congratulate Mrs Ferrer on her excellent report , but despite that I also have to record that , regrettably , we cannot vote for it this time .
Our decision has nothing to do with her work , it relates to the situation in Mexico .
Mr Zedillo promised to let me have full details to prove to me that our concern was groundless .
The days have gone by and still the information from Mr Zedillo has not come .
Meanwhile , information is reaching us from many sources indicating that serious human rights violations are continuing in many places , increasing our concern .
Last time , we consulted with the parties on the left in Mexico on how to vote and we decided to abstain .
Mr President , I will not discuss the content of this agreement since many speakers , including the rapporteur , have already covered it .
I just want to highlight the political significance of the signing of this free trade agreement between the European Union and Mexico .
Mexico ' s membership of the OECD was just mentioned , and its observer status at the Council of Europe should also be remembered .
Nor should we forget the opportunities represented by this market of 100 million people .
But obviously this political symbolism can in no way allay our concern about environmental issues , social issues and above all human rights issues , and many speakers have already referred to them here today .
What we do know is that our concern must make us more rigorous in our relations with Mexico .
That is just what we will be in ten days ' time .
The European Parliament ' s delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico will be visiting that country .
We are not going just for institutional dialogue between partners , between the Congress and the European Parliament .
We are going to talk to non-governmental organisations .
We are also going to Chiapas to talk to the indigenous people and representatives of local society .
That is how rigorous we believe we need to be but it will not detract from our support for approval of this agreement .
Overall , I feel that we can but support this agreement , for the reasons expressed by Messrs Westendorp y Cabeza and Seguro , whose opinions I share .
I therefore feel that the Council and the Commission should take great care when implementing this agreement , and continually monitor its application for as long as it is in force .
I support the agreement in its entirety , for it certainly represents a step forward .
However , I also call for scrutiny , care and prudence regarding this agreement for its entire duration .
Mr President , first of all I want to thank Madam Ferrer for the report and Parliament for the very constructive input with regard to the results of the trade negotiations with Mexico .
These results of the trade negotiations are based on the EU-Mexico agreement to which this Parliament gave the green light on 6 May last year .
This agreement is based on human rights and democratic principles .
It covers all our relations with Mexico , notably cooperation and political dialogue .
The negotiating results are balanced , ambitious and offer a window of opportunity for both sides .
All important areas are included , notably trade in goods , services , procurement , intellectual property rights , competition , capital movement , investment and dispute settlement .
EC operators will be very rapidly able to compete on the Mexican market on an equal footing with industries elsewhere , notably the United States .
As in all negotiations , compromises had to be found in certain areas but the results are a balanced package assuring market access while preserving specific sensitivities .
Last , but not least , I would like to express the Commission 's high appreciation of the very short time period of one month in which the Parliament will be delivering its opinion .
It is very important because it will pave the way for organising a meeting of the EC-Mexico Joint Council on the margins of the Lisbon Council next week .
This will allow for the rapid entry into force of the results which , as you recognise , are in both our and Mexico 's interest .
Thank you very much , Mr Liikanen .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Information society for All
Mr President , may I start by thanking the Commission for its timely , well-judged and well-forecasted document .
We ought to put this into some sort of context , though , and remind ourselves that the majority of people in the world have never made and probably never will make even one phone call .
The Commission proposals and Parliament 's response give a clear acknowledgement that the market can and should be the motor for much of this change , but not in every case .
The challenge is to work out when the European Union should let the market do the driving , and when we should intervene and regulate - when we should intervene , in whose interests and for how long .
The adoption of the GSM standard has meant that the European Union has a tremendous advantage .
I hope that there will be support for those , because they go into a considerable amount of important detail .
Other amendments are looking at matters relating to disability rights .
We have amendments about consumer protection - so important in the establishment of trust in e-commerce - on the future of taxation , on the implications for healthcare and for transport .
It is important , too , that we in Parliament and in the institutions of the European Union also apply modern methods , methods characterised by transparency and openness , in our own deliberations .
I should like to use my final few seconds to draw to your attention three projects in my own area .
Further north , the Nottingham rural community council have set up a similar project in an area of serious mining deprivation , and this is bringing enormous benefits to many of the people in that area .
On a broader basis , M-net , the European East Midlands network helping small businesses and craft enterprises and linking in with universities and colleges , is also important .
Finally , some comments , Mr President , on what the future holds .
I think for all of us the future for our children and grandchildren is a future of great opportunity , though also of great uncertainty .
It is praiseworthy that the Commission is looking to play a leading , pivotal role in this , and I commend the Commission proposals and my own report to you .
We have been working against the clock and we have been dealing with an excellent and supportive fellow Member , who has been very open to accepting all the points our committee wanted to raise in this important debate .
Many thanks for your report and your skill , Mrs Read .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has welcomed the Commission ' s very important initiative , e-Europe , for the Special European Council to be held in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March , with support and optimism .
We still do not have much idea of who is going to finance the massive programme to teach basic digital literacy which Europe needs to close the gap with the United States .
We do not have much idea of how the responsibilities can be divided between governments and Commission , or what role trade unions and civil society can play .
Commissioner , there are great opportunities here , but they must reach all the people .
And we want the European social model to be defended .
So we are asking for a step forward , with more specific commitments and far more adequate political and financial efforts .
Mr President , Commissioner Liikanen , the e-Europe initiative by the European Commission is to be welcomed in principle .
We all agree that new technologies will lead to extensive change , not only in our business life but in all aspects of our social life .
It is also true that the evolution from industrial society to information society cannot be halted and that it therefore makes political sense to prepare Europe for the information society as best we can .
The European Commission sets out ten measures in its communication on the e-Europe initiative , which should level the playing field in the run up to the information society in Europe .
As welcome as the individual measures are , they need to be structured as a whole and clear priorities need to be set for our policy .
In this respect , the summit in Lisbon should table recommendations to the individual states , without imposing comprehensive obligations or heavy financial burdens .
What must the European Union do within the framework of the e-Europe initiative ?
First : we must create an open , modern , high-performance multimedia infrastructure .
This includes cheaper Internet access for all the citizens of Europe , which means fostering even more competition in local networks , for example by unbundling customer access .
It also means that all platforms must be made accessible to service providers at competitive prices ; this might include making television cables available .
It also means that the policy regarding frequencies in Europe will need to be reviewed and we will need to take a more strategic approach based on economic principles , as you have suggested , Commissioner .
But , in so doing , we must not , of course , forget commercial applications which are generally provided in the public interest , such as public service radio .
On the contrary , this must be taken into account when frequencies are being allocated so that it can fulfil its purpose as an opinion-forming institution which provides a platform for a variety of opinions .
Secondly : we must quickly create a legal framework for electronic commerce .
This means that we must deal swiftly with legislative proposals pending , such as the e-commerce directive or the directive amending copyright protection .
However , caution is required in the legislative area in that we must not over-regulate ; in other words , the first question with future legislative proposals should always be , do we actually need this ?
Thirdly : we need an e-Europe test bench for European initiatives .
I have already referred to the fact that the changes in information technology and the new media affect all areas of life .
Consequently , it is advisable to set all initiatives at European level on the e-Europe test bench . In other words ...
( The President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , I apologise .
Please be so kind as to allow me to finish my sentence .
Mr President , congratulations are in order today of course to Mrs Read on her excellent report and to Commissioner Liikanen .
This is a positive debate , very positive for Europe , and widespread interest has been shown , as evidenced by the large number of amendments .
I know that we will have a very good advertising and information campaign , and that we will capture the imagination of the citizens of Europe .
We must not forget people with disabilities .
There is also the fact that the documentation is not available to partially sighted people , and that is an oversight which could be put right in future .
We must prevent divisions , divisions between the regions of Europe , between the households of Europe and between the individuals of Europe .
Business-to-business communications are doing well but we must enhance communications between business and consumers in the European Union , where we lag behind the United States .
Of course , to do that we have to ensure that people - customers - are convinced of privacy and security , and your measures will help to bring about that confidence .
We can also see this from the follow-up document prepared by the Commission .
The initiative is important if we are to stop having to say that the United States is the overall leader within this developing field .
According to the " 2000 IDC / World Times Information Society Index " , published in February , Sweden has overtaken the United States as the leading information economy .
The United States occupies second place . Finland , Norway and Denmark follow , in that order .
Scandinavia is acquitting itself well with its social infrastructure and also , perhaps , with its pensions systems .
We ought to bear this in mind , something I am convinced the Commission has done .
We should also remember that the EU countries are very different from one another and that developments are very rapid .
This must be reflected in the action plan .
It is also important that the countries which are forging ahead most quickly should not be checked in their development .
In view of countries ' different levels of development in the IT sphere , I am also sceptical about information plans and campaigns at EU level . " e-Europe " means more than just " e-commerce " .
The Directive on electronic commerce deals for the most part with things other than trading on the part of consumers .
I should like to appeal to the Commission to pay attention to the question which is being discussed in an adjoining room with Federal Trade Commissioner Thompson : that of how we are to increase consumer confidence .
The consumer has to be king when it comes to electronic commerce . Otherwise , it will not properly take off .
When alternative ways of solving disputes are discussed , we ought to collaborate globally with the United States . Nonetheless , we should also support the OECD in its work .
The issues of broadband communications and of good infrastructure are on the agenda in the majority of countries .
There is a need for diversity , but now more standards are being sought for Digital Subscriber Lines with the help of which it will be possible to upgrade the network .
It is widely maintained that telephone companies are not making use of the available technology because standards are lacking .
Smart cards , encryption , mobile phones and " e-Europe " constitute our strength .
We shall persist with developments in these areas but , when it comes to standards , we need to pursue further development .
It is not we politicians who should decide on these standards . Instead , we should allow industry to reach an agreement concerning standards where there is a demand for these .
Our task is to legislate more quickly and to make for new patterns of legislation where possible .
I am glad that this point is made in the report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , rapporteur , allow me to thank you for the open debate and , of course , the report .
I should like to turn my attention first to the policy approach of the e-Europe initiative and to the approach taken by the Read report .
The Internet , e-mail and mobile telephones will apparently do away with unemployment .
But the reality of the matter is somewhat different .
The IT boom is confronted by mergers and redundancies .
History teaches us that this approach has failed .
Industrialisation , atomic energy and biotechnology have not brought freedom and prosperity for all .
Initiatives and reports are informed by the concept that the playing field should be levelled for the youngest and best .
Unfortunately , this concept totally ignores the fact that this group already represents the winners , while the general mass goes away empty-handed .
What we need to do is to allow everyone to profit from technical innovation , irrespective of how old or how rich they are or in which region they live .
We should hold our principle of equal opportunity up to the light of truth .
A universal service points the right way , but the idea should not be implemented by providers which censor the Internet by using technical devices to deny their customers access to parts of the Net .
The Commission ' s proposal aims to create equality through market liberalisation .
That alone is nonsensical enough because liberalisation always starts from the premise that the strong will become stronger , while the state should only give the weak minimum support .
In the case of information technology , however , we start with a totally different set of coordinates .
For example , there are numerous initiatives to promote the Internet and computers in schools .
But if no account is taken of the fact that each class contains at least one pupil who knows more than the teacher , then the initiative cannot but fail .
The fact that strong anti-American arguments had to be used at numerous points of the Read report as an excuse for the liberalisation policy again illustrates the extent to which the interests of private industry have dictated the text .
That brings me to my next controversial point : civil rights .
What we in fact need is a concept for universal data protection .
Instead , the Commission and parts of the European Parliament visualise a smart card on which all your data would be stored .
Your medical health fund would know that you are homosexual and your employer would know all about your previous and expected future illnesses and your forefathers .
It means a step in the direction of see-through man and yet more state interference in our private lives .
It is being used to deliberately plan and implement a further massive restriction of fundamental rights at European level .
It is being sold as an innovative policy at the same time as Parliament is arguing with other institutions for a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
How can these two things be reconciled ?
In the light of " echelon " , I am calling for a rethink of this matter .
Data protection and encoding are what we need .
For the rest , the citizens must control the state , not the other way around .
Mr President , in the original paper in English , the Commission uses the words ' information society ' and not ' knowledge society ' .
These are two different things .
Information is only a raw material of knowledge . Information is chaos , while knowledge is order : order out of chaos .
The information society is the chaos society .
The knowledge society is more than that , and it may also be a society of social order , cultural diversity and human solidarity .
The information society has to date made its presence felt in the form of price quotations on a chaotic stock market .
The prices of shares in technology have risen in a such a way which cannot be justified economically .
Neither has the money often gone into new investment for business but to the owners , who have become millionaires and billionaires .
In that way the information society emerges as a bubble economy , a symbol of social inequality and imbalance .
The information society has been a matter of millionaires causing a social revolution : they have innovatively destroyed the old structures of society .
Their revolution has been to sell computers and software to everyone .
The rest of us should start a counter-revolution .
We should set our aims higher than the Commission has done .
We have to demand a knowledge society for all rather than the chaotic information society we are getting .
It cannot just be a question of whether everyone has a mobile phone , how e-mail gets sent and what to buy over the Internet .
At its best the knowledge society can be a social dimension of the new capitalism .
The information society for all is too undemanding , too commercial and too culturally restricted a goal .
We should want a knowledge society for all : that is democracy .
Mr President , ' the best is the enemy of the good ' , as they say in France , and I do fear Mrs Read ' s report is a striking illustration of that saying .
Yet I fear that the catalogue of good intentions before us today may , in fact , make it more difficult to achieve the objective we are seeking .
In what way is the Commission ' s document compatible with the existence of tax provisions in the field of commerce and employment specific to the various Member States ?
How can we ensure respect for our concepts of the freedom of the individual and freedom of expression , which have not yet been harmonised at world level ?
It is rather surprising , Mrs Ferrer , to read in paragraph 55 of your report that this Parliament expressly supports ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Commissioner , it is a very positive sign that Lisbon will see focused discussion on the development of the information society in Europe .
The ' new economy ' is here to stay , in Europe too .
The European response to new challenges and exploiting opportunities has , however , been a long time coming .
For that reason , the e-Europe initiative is in a more crucially important position than ever before with regard to Union competitiveness and , consequently , from the point of view of our citizens also .
The proposals for reform in the initiative are ambitious , but do not even necessarily go far enough .
The goals are too modest , especially for my home country of Finland , where , in many respects , we are ahead of our European partners in networking .
The initiative should also be supplemented by the future challenges facing those countries with a more advanced information society .
Commissioner , I appreciate the amount of work that you , to your credit , have carried out regarding these issues relating to the information society .
We Members of the European Parliament cannot stand by either , while Europe continually lags behind its global competitors in the world of the Internet .
The clear lead Europe enjoys in the world of wireless communications is not enough for us to stop caring about the future of the European information society and about whether we really can keep up with the competition .
Being in a key position when creating the information society encourages real competition in telecommunications networks .
Competition cuts costs , and we have to bring down these very costs of communications , so that consumers and SMEs can derive full benefit from the electronic revolution .
Apart from reduced costs , the growth in electronic commerce also means that questions of security should be able to be resolved to the satisfaction of consumers and that defects in legislation should be corrected .
I think it is particularly important to take measures to increase venture capital projects for SMEs in the high technology sector .
The EUR 20 billion currently being used in venture capital projects in Europe each year is only one quarter of what the United States spends over the same period .
The amount is much too small .
Fortunately , the Commission has shown initiative in this matter , however , and has focused attention on accelerating developments here .
Speedy developments in the information society will drastically change our environment and our working and living conditions .
As European legislators , we have before us an immense challenge , if we intend to keep legislation abreast of the times .
The legislator does not always even have to interfere in developments : in certain matters industry and the players themselves may quickly resolve problems through cooperation .
Examples would be the positive experience that was gained from the common standardisation of second generation mobile phone systems and which is directly visible now in the strengthened competitive position with regard to third generation output .
Control of the new operational environment will also require increased technical and pedagogic facilities and resources in training schemes .
Consequently , there will have to be more focus on the training of teaching staff in European educational and training programmes .
Finally I would like to say that I support the introduction of benchmarking with regard to the development of the information society .
With regard to the concrete proposals contained in the e-Europe communiqué , I can only wonder why the Council has not discussed them before , so as to ensure commitment on the part of Member States .
This is more than an economic challenge : it is a process of profound cultural change which must filter down to every family , every school , every company and every public authority .
There is a genuine need for this , given the suspicion with which our fellow citizens approach these new tools .
I trust that during work on the action plan , following the Lisbon Summit , there will be more effective cooperation between the two Committees .
Moreover , I set great store by protecting small and medium-sized businesses , with special emphasis on the small businesses .
In this connection , it is important to ensure that guarantees are provided for advertising purposes .
Indeed , due to a lack of a harmonised policy on commercial communication , obstacles could well surface which cannot be negotiated , particularly by small businesses .
Far-reaching harmonisation concerning commercial communication is therefore urgently needed .
Mr President , with the e-Europe initiative , the Commission is reminding us that Europe is lagging behind in the development of the information society .
That means it is lagging behind the United States which , indeed , no one would deny .
But having said that , we should evaluate the quality of this backwardness : economic , political and social . How do we measure it ?
The Commission says it wants to launch a political initiative , so let us take it at its word .
Yes , Europe is backward in terms of access to the information society as a tool , a tool of knowledge , a tool of creativity , a tool for exchanging information .
Yes , it is backward in terms of the development of e-commerce made possible by the Internet .
But are these two forms of backwardness the same ?
Some might say ' no matter ' , we must strive for the wholesale development of the magnificent tool of digital information and that is an end in itself .
That is the impression the Commission ' s initiative could give .
The question that has not been asked is about the content of the information that is supposed to circulate thanks to this digital tool .
Will that content be standardised or will it reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of Europe ?
Will it be a social content or purely market-related ?
Even now , the information society is creating social networks , giving rise to new cultural experiences , producing sites for political debate and exchanges of view .
We need to evaluate them properly .
The Commission refers to Europe ' s backwardness and the need to make up for it .
Between considerations of backwardness and urgency , we must not confine ourselves to speeding up this process but must instead consider the democratic and political conditions under which it takes place .
Technological progress is an all-too familiar slogan .
In fact , the transformation we are witnessing is reminiscent of what happened with the invention of printing .
We need to reflect very seriously about the challenges and changes it is bringing about .
The new technologies which we are debating here have , for the most part , radically altered the bases of production , service , distribution , trade , research , use of information etc. in our societies .
I think we are all fascinated by all the new products and applications which are being made available .
One such example is , of course , the area of education .
We live at a time when education is becoming ever more important as a factor in production .
One aspect to which little attention is paid in this area is that knowledge , unlike other production factors ( such as capital , minerals , and agricultural and other land ) , is not a scarce resource .
Knowledge has a clear tendency to increase or to expand when it is used .
It opens the door to incredibly exciting developments where democracy and justice are concerned .
We are all born with the potential to learn and acquire knowledge . This cannot , however , occur without good prior conditions for education and learning .
That is why the proposal in this report , according to which resources for education and learning would be made available , is so important .
It is not , however , just a question of technical equipment . It is also a question of developing new teaching methods and distance learning .
This is important in our own part of the world but is also , of course , especially important in poor countries .
Another area which is just as important is that of the opportunities for using the new technologies to make the use of energy and materials more efficient .
Commendably , in my view , the present programme refers to the area of transport .
Do not forget , however , that it is also possible , to a significant degree , to achieve an actual physical reduction in transport needs , which is something we should be trying to come to grips with .
We are only at the beginning of an important discussion , and I look forward to further stimulating dialogue .
Thank you , Mr Liikanen and Mrs Read , for an interesting report .
Mr President , Commissioner , metaphorically-speaking , what we have in the new I + C technologies is new fuel for our economic locomotive to re-heat our eco-system .
However , I should like to raise three points which perhaps merit our attention .
First : Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam clearly calls for the principle of sustainability to be integrated into all policies .
Improvements are therefore needed here .
Secondly : how will our working life and employment relations change ?
Will people be able to influence how they are organised ?
We need to consider if we need new joint-decision structures in the face of these revolutionary developments , new structures for listening to employees and making decisions .
Greater account needs to be taken of this .
Thirdly : the Fifth Framework Programme on research contains a great deal of socio-economic research , the purpose of which is to analyse what holds Europe together in the area of I + C technologies .
We cannot fill and heat our locomotive with ordinary fuel and , at the same time , carry out socio-economic flanking research under the framework programme which makes no reference to this communication .
In short , we need to heat the locomotive but not to allow it to travel anywhere it pleases . This locomotive needs rails .
Mr President , colleagues , not since the spread of universal suffrage in the last century has our society faced such a big potential transfer of power .
The information society has potential to transfer power from government to individual , from bureaucrat to citizen and , of course , from business to consumer .
It opens up a global market place and almost limitless information to anyone with access to a computer screen .
It is the biggest engine to break down barriers between communities and nationalities that we have ever seen - bigger than any EU directive can possibly be .
Legislators cannot keep up with this technology even if they try to .
Technology and industry are better equipped to respond to consumer concerns in what is an immensely competitive market .
But we all know that we need a base line of government involvement .
We need a basic legislative framework for e-commerce .
I hope it will be a light-touch framework , but we need to drive it through quickly because the e-clock is ticking and there are many organisations around the world fighting for this business .
It is in our interest to make sure that we get the answers and our legislation right , but also to get them through quickly .
We in this House should drive through the e-commerce directive with its country of origin principle as fast as we possibly can .
We should adopt new rules on jurisdiction which trust consumers to make an informed choice about which jurisdiction they want to opt for .
We want to build on Europe 's lead on mobile telephony and adopt the examples of such great global players as Finland 's Nokia .
I think three points need to be noted , as well as the risks and concerns to which they give rise .
The first relates to the users and the risk of a gap emerging between the various victims of social exclusion .
My third and last point relates to the question of public service and improving the democratic systems to develop procedures ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Commissioner , e-Europe is a really important programme for everyone en route from the industrial society to the information society .
I would therefore like to congratulate the Portuguese presidency on its decision to make this issue the focus of the special summit .
I should like to congratulate the Commission on its proposal and the rapporteur on her report and I should like to explain why I have praised you and why I should like to take you all at your word .
This goal , in my view , does not justify the concerns raised here about a possible division in society between the haves and have-nots as far as access to information is concerned .
That is a task for the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
I wish us all a great deal of success in the interests of our citizens .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for the successful work that has been done in so short a period of time .
An information society for all is certainly an area of focus for the Commissioner in this process .
It is important , and I thank her for it .
Agreement should be reached at Lisbon on the principles of the sustainable funding of social security on account of this notion .
We also have to reach agreement with management and labour , for example , on the subject of remote working and vocational training , if what we are talking about is an information society for all .
It will not be so if the basic rights of employees are not safeguarded .
There is a threat that , because of the Internet , services will become self-services , and that again is a major employment issue .
Another matter is that we have been deregulating the telecommunications industry for around ten years , and now , with these massive Internet players merging there is a fear that they will once again start regulating the market .
This , I think , should be stopped .
It cannot be allowed to happen and I expect the Commission to sit up and listen and take the necessary action .
Thirdly , the quoted share value for a certain Internet company rose by a sudden 4 000 % in one month , and this came about merely because unsubstantiated information was given about it for the stock market .
While stressing that many people had hoped for clearer answers in this area from the employment summit , I do not undervalue the relevance of the issue and the need to define a European strategy for the sector .
We all know the Union is lagging far behind the United States in this sensitive area , which is so vital to our future .
I concur with Mrs Read ' s report and , borrowing an expression used here by the President of the Council , António Guterres , I want to highlight the three main deficits in the sector .
First there is the pragmatic deficit .
As the Read report correctly points out , the document put forward by the Commission is full of general guidelines and laudable intentions , but it is weak on concrete measures and ensuing actions .
I would not like to believe the Council ' s conclusions will be restricted to this list .
On this issue , as on others , we do not need more statements and speeches , we need measures and decisions that can reduce the huge lead the United States has on us .
Our first concern must be to prioritise our commitment to the educational system and in the carrier and telecommunications structures which make access to the Internet cheaper , faster and more powerful .
And finally there is the investment deficit .
As the report rightly affirms , the response to these problems cannot be left to the market alone .
Mr President , the point of the special summit in Lisbon next week is to define the European way in the future world of employment .
How can we become more competitive ?
How can we create new markets ?
How can we create permanent , more highly-qualified jobs ?
We can take one of the leading roles in tomorrow ' s global information society , provided that we learn the script .
Europe has talents .
Europe has skills .
Occasionally we lack competent directors to motivate us .
I personally feel that it is important for broad target groups to take an active part in these serious changes .
They need to familiarise themselves with the Internet and data bases from an early age .
Mrs Hieronymi pointed that out .
Schools without computers must become the exception .
We need a qualification offensive with computer-aided learning and active use of networks .
The European Parliament ' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is calling for the information society to become the common property of all citizens , including the socially weak , the disabled and older people .
The pace of change is hotting up in the European economy .
Undertakings are subject to constant restructuring , new holdings , strategic alliances and friendly or hostile takeovers .
The consequences for both employees and managers is the same : greater mobility and faster and faster adjustment .
Independence is increasing , as is pseudo-independence .
Within companies , responsibilities are changing .
Teams have shorter and shorter sell-by dates .
That has repercussions for the internal composition and the representation of the interests of employees .
Many companies are too small to set up works councils or are so large that relationships are not even forged and employee representatives become roving ambassadors .
People in ICT professions who have a great deal of freedom , analysts , engineers and creative planners , want to be their own bosses .
They are fighting for new working time regulations and new variable contract-based tariff and remuneration systems .
In addition , trade unions in other areas fear that unregulated structures will spread and social standards will drop .
Citizens must be familiar with new forms of work and working relations in the information and communications industry , be they in the hardware sector , the software sector , services or consultancy .
Mr President , I want to begin by thanking Mrs Read for all the work she has put into the present report .
It is wonderful that there should be such a lot of interest in this area .
I believe it is important that , here in the European Parliament , we should now promote further knowledge of these complex and exciting developments and create a readiness to implement the necessary changes .
Commissioner Liikanen , with his personal commitment , and the Commission ' s " e-Europe " document represent a positive vision of the new economy and a growth-orientated policy which I wholeheartedly support .
It is unfortunate that certain Members see the burgeoning information society as a threat , rather than appreciate the opportunities it involves .
The significance of e-commerce is difficult to overestimate .
In the wake of technological change , there will not only be changes to patterns of trade , but new opportunities will also be created where the arts , entertainment and personal contacts are concerned .
In order to best support the new economy , it is important that we as politicians should not believe that we can foresee companies ' and people ' s every need .
We must allow the market , that is to say purchasers and vendors , to choose for themselves .
In view of the way this part of society and of the economy looks , it is even more important not to engage in a fever of regulation by controlling activities in every detail .
Instead , we must further deregulate markets so as to increase competition with a view to reducing prices .
That is definitely the best way of making information services available to all citizens .
An important part of creating growth in the new economy is to increase the flow of venture capital for newly started-up and expanding businesses .
We must increase competitiveness and the development of ideas in our part of the world , that is to say in Europe .
To the left-hand side of this House , I would say , following the present debate : try to affirm the opportunities available to people because of the information revolution .
Avoid being so fearful and negative .
Take Mrs Villiers ' insights on board .
Adopt Mr Wijkman ' s global and positive attitude , and learn from young Mrs Kauppi ' s experiences .
I do not think we should underestimate the problem of making the relevant adjustments , but do not bury this initiative in your old conceptual world .
That would be Europe ' s loss .
We welcome the contribution of Parliament to this very important policy debate .
The Commission is currently contributing to the preparation of next week 's summit in Lisbon .
To this end , the Commission has adopted several communications including a progress report on e-Europe last week and a paper setting out an agenda for economic and social renewal for Europe two weeks ago .
I find it very important that Parliament is participating through today 's debate in the discussions before the Lisbon Summit .
The debate has been really illuminating and has shown the great interest and also the expertise of Parliament on this issue .
We hope that the Lisbon European Council will endorse concrete , focused policy actions providing a strong signal that European leaders are determined to transform Europe into a dynamic and competitive economy .
As to the content of your reports , I note that you have expressed concern that mechanisms through which the targets of e-Europe are to be achieved are not made explicit in our initial document .
In this context , the progress report submitted by the Commission to the Lisbon Council last week and also submitted to you last week will provide further details .
In addition , there will be an e-Europe action plan by June as requested at the Helsinki Summit .
I am particularly pleased to see that the report shares the Commission 's view on the key elements of e-Europe .
It is essential to create a modern multimedia high-performance e-infrastructure , to create legal certainty in e-commerce , to counteract the skills shortage and to improve the availability of risk capital to stimulate innovation .
Your support to move forward on these key elements of e-Europe is most welcome .
I find the idea of organising an e-government conference highly interesting .
It is important that we in the European institutions , along with Member States , develop effective means of exploiting the potential of regional technologies , to increase both the efficiency and transparency of our interactions with citizens .
I can report to you that this will be one of the main topics of a ministerial conference organised by the Portuguese presidency in Lisbon in early April .
I would also like to add that the White Paper on the Commission 's internal reform contains an " e-Commission " action .
The aim is to enhance the Commission 's IT and communications infrastructure in order to provide better service by means of the Internet .
I would like to briefly respond to some items where the emphasis of the discussion has perhaps been a little different from the Commission document .
The Commission is asked to include an eleventh action line on employment and social cohesion .
I fully accept that these are very high priorities , and for that very reason particular communications have been accepted on these subjects .
I would like to mention especially the communication " Strategies for Jobs in the Information Society " .
I also agree with you that the information society is perhaps the biggest opportunity for structural policies and policies for cohesion that we have had , because it means the death of distance .
The " e-Europe " communication focuses on the actions necessary to accelerate the transition to the information society .
These actions will result in increasing numbers of jobs and will thereby reduce the principal cause of social exclusion , namely unemployment .
Your report expresses concern about the smart card action .
I would like to assure you that this action is not intended to intervene in an area that , the report rightly notes , is market-driven .
The Commission 's role is purely a facilitating one , bringing together the key actors and enabling them to move towards agreement on standard approaches .
The aim is not to disadvantage other technologies .
Finally , I would like to close by thanking you once again for your work in this area .
The efforts which you have made confirm that you share with us a sense of the importance and urgency of this issue for Europe .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
Vote
Mr President , the debate on my report on the European Union ' s action plans on asylum-seekers and migrants has been postponed until this evening at 6 p.m. , and the vote until tomorrow at 9 a.m.
I would like to see the importance of the issue reflected in the debate and vote in this House .
So I would ask you to put it to the House that the debate be deferred to the next part-session in Brussels .
( Parliament agreed to the request )
Before these votes are taken , I think it is important for this House and the Bureau to decide , finally , whether the Strasbourg sittings finish on Thursday or if there should still be sittings on Fridays .
Mr President , I have asked to take the floor simply because the Italian translation of paragraph 6c is very strange .
We have sent a note in this regard , but nothing has been done about it , and so I would ask you now to investigate the matter .
The text appears to be saying that violations of fundamental rights are permitted if the European Parliament is in agreement , which seems rather absurd to me .
Mr President , I would like to draw attention to the text of paragraph 6 ( c ) , in line with the doubts raised by Mrs Frassoni .
I do not know if this is a language problem or a political problem , given the speeches we have heard here about Austrian political rights .
We always have a check on the language versions to make sure they conform to the original language version at the end of the votes .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , one other brief point .
It violates the Rules of Procedure and should not happen again .
I have some sympathy with that remark .
Perhaps we should ask the Rules of Procedure Committee to look at the precise procedural methods we use here .
It is very clear that if a report has come from a committee , the committee can request referral back .
But when it has been set on the agenda at the beginning of the week I am not clear that Members can move deferral .
I was not sure , so we should refer it to the Rules Committee .
The Commission has not expressed its opinion on that .
The Council of State ruled that the procedure had not been respected , i.e. that the mayors and regional and local authorities , organisations and associations concerned had not been consulted .
We do not know exactly what the situation is at present .
To ensure that Member States are not unjustly penalised , I move that the vote on this report be deferred until the Commission has delivered its reasoned opinion on action to be taken following the Council of State decree .
I also think Parliament cannot be both judge and judged .
We could have a long debate about this but rather than get into a procedural wrangle , you are not , strictly speaking , entitled to move this .
I am not going to debate it .
The easier thing is to put it to the vote .
( Parliament rejected the proposal )
My second point is that we do not believe it is in the remit of the legislative authority to decide whether the laws have been transposed . That is up to the Commission and also the Court of Justice .
Mr President , I simply wanted to say that if Mrs Lienemann was so worried it is a pity she did not take part in the debate and make her points to the Commissioner during the debate .
Mr President , I agree with that remark , for I am surprised at some of the statements made here .
This is in fact the first time this kind of observation , which was not heard in committee , has been made , and I regret it .
Today we are to vote on this resolution , which is why we are asking for a vote on the work done in committee .
With reference to the Rules of Procedure , I would therefore take the liberty of proposing that the matter be postponed and referred back to committee .
Moreover , Mrs Jackson , I tabled numerous amendments calling for the series of paragraphs you had proposed to be deleted .
My amendments were not adopted in committee and I therefore felt it was not acceptable for us to continue on these bases .
Mrs Isler Béguin was not in committee on the days we discussed these subjects .
You will find exactly the same arguments I have put forward today in the Minutes of the committee meeting and in my amendments .
I know we have a great deal of work in committee and that colleagues cannot always remember amendments in detail , which I fully understand .
However , I wanted to point this out .
Mr President , I am sorry , I have been trying to catch your attention but you are going very fast , on which I congratulate you .
On Mrs Jackson ' s report , I just want to say that I did not take part in the vote for similar reasons to Mrs Lienemann .
I believe respect for Community law must be general and cannot be based on selective , and therefore necessarily arbitrary , interpretations .
I ask for it to be recorded in the Minutes that I did not take part in the vote .
Concerning paragraph 45 :
Mr President , before we vote on paragraph 45 , I would like the rapporteur to hear what I have to say .
I would like to know whether this clause has the same meaning in his language .
Would the rapporteur be so kind as to inform us whether his version is the authentic version , for , if so , the meaning is the complete opposite to the Italian .
Mr President , I believe I can shed some light on the matter .
I have read the French version of the text , and it is completely different from the Italian version at this point .
This a serious translation error .
I feel sure that the Italian is a mistranslation .
The original version probably said " not to imprison young people who commit offences , except in special cases " .
I think this is the root of the problem .
I am able to confirm that it is Mr Imbeni ' s interpretation which is the correct one .
The French , Danish and English versions are correct .
The phrase is to be understood as Mr Imbeni said .
Mr President , if we change the meaning of the paragraph , the debate will start all over again .
It is a common occurrence in this Parliament for texts not to correspond .
Do you remember when , a few months ago , we were told to distribute condoms to priests ?
This time , according to some versions , we are told to protect child abusers .
If we change the English version as well , Mr President , we will have to start the debate afresh and , seeing as your plane leaves at 4.30 this afternoon , this does not seem appropriate .
Maybe it would be better to stop at the comma , after " physical and psychological abuse and all kinds of discrimination " .
We could then deal with the behaviour of young people who commit offences later on , in one of the many other reports which are churned out by Parliament .
Mr President , the rapporteur clearly explained the meaning of the text in the sense referred to by Mr Imbeni .
You have read the English version of the text , which is accepted by the overwhelming majority of those present .
I really must ask you to allow us to continue the vote , especially as these little semantic games always come from the people who take no part in the technical work in committee .
That would overcome all the difficulty .
There is no ambiguity , there is no uncertainty .
Mr President , a number of words have been omitted from paragraph 61 of the Danish version .
It is the English version which is correct .
In the Danish version , the following words should be added after the words " trade unions " : " as well as the rights of individuals vis-à-vis trade unions " .
It is , then , not only a question of the right to form trade unions but also of rights vis-à-vis these trade unions .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Mr President , I should like to make a point of order .
We voted on this report in committee , a committee on which all groups are represented .
We dealt with 170 amendments to this report in committee .
We have now been presented with 66 amendments in plenary .
This is not a legislative report .
If the House continues to organise its business in this way we will not only be a laughing-stock but we will fail to get through the very serious business that we have .
We ask the appropriate bodies in this House to look again at the way in which we organise our work .
As it happens , we have a report by Mr Provan in which the Bureau is looking at how the plenary functions .
We had a debate on that in the Bureau on Tuesday and I made exactly the point you have just made .
So I agree with you one hundred percent .
Mr President , this is only the fourth point of order I have raised in nearly eleven years as an MEP , so I hope you will listen .
I want to ask you and those others who preside over these sessions to be much more strict about points of order .
That hardly constitutes a point of order .
I ask you - and I echo Mr Watson 's point of order - to take those points back to your President and co-Vice-Presidents and ask them to be much tougher .
It might make you unpopular in the short-run but I think it would make you loved and admired in the long-run .
I am usually accused of being too brusque with Members who want to make a point of order .
I suppose I cannot win .
The trouble is that when people ask for the floor on a point of order you do not know if it is a valid point until they have made it .
Mr President , you mentioned that you wanted to break off now .
I urgently request that you continue the vote .
We are fed up with constant changes to the agenda and postponements at short notice .
I therefore ask that you quickly resume and complete the vote on the Ludford report and the rest of the agenda .
I agree with Mr Pirker , and it is probably the only thing I will agree with him on if we do vote on the Ludford report .
It is going to be an interesting vote .
It is unreasonable at this stage to postpone it to a time when a lot of people will have left .
If you are intending to postpone it to 5.30 p.m. , it will totally distort the vote on this report .
I urge that we carry on now , understanding all the difficulties that you have mentioned .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I understand what is being asked here .
But what I have to say to you is this : take a look around the House , it has already voted , with its feet !
The members have already left !
We cannot work seriously if we follow the procedure which you have suggested , Mr President ; nor can we do so if we work here with random majorities .
Now more members may have left from one group than from other and that may well distort the vote on the Ludford report .
Even the rapporteur does not want that .
For the rest , we can still vote at 5.30 this evening .
That is quite in order .
I think we should work here with a properly-ordered procedure .
We have already overrun by 45 minutes .
I suggest that we vote this evening .
In fact , every time Parliament decides to deal with the issue of long voting sessions it ends up suppressing the rights of the individual Members .
The point is , that part-sessions run from Monday to Friday , and if you have to leave earlier for some reason , then that is your problem , not the fault of the voting session .
Mr President , I should like to request that it not be taken this evening .
The vote will be totally distorted .
We know that a lot of people will leave this afternoon .
They do not expect this kind of vote on a Thursday afternoon .
Could we not postpone it until the April plenary session in Strasbourg ?
I am afraid that would have to be decided before we take the vote this evening .
This is shameful .
We have been here for less than two hours and we have already had enough .
What would sailors , pilots , drivers , petrol station workers and doctors say ?
I find it absolutely absurd that we are not able to work for more than two hours at a time .
You are just making the point that I made when I said we could not carry on with the votes .
Mr President , I think the translation of Mr Speroni ' s speech may not have been entirely correct . He appeared to me to be saying the complete opposite regarding the decision taken .
Mr President , in order to be completely fair , you should have called for one intervention for the decision to suspend the sitting or continue and adhere to the scheduled voting time and one intervention against .
Once again , the wishes of the Chamber have been disregarded . Democracy only exists on paper : it is not applied within this Parliament .
Mr President , I am sorry but I asked for the floor at the start .
Two specific points .
First , I wanted to vote for , not against proposed amendment 24 .
We have done so for years and we can be flexible one way or the other pretty much as we please .
Perhaps all the members should be reminded of that .
Members are supposed to work here through to Friday , so that we can use the afternoons to see our visitors .
Mr President , perhaps I can be of help here .
The rapporteur has stated that she agrees with your suggestion , i.e. with the President ' s suggestion .
Allow me to recapitulate : the President said that we are to vote at 5.30 this evening on whether or not to postpone the vote until the next plenary session .
Please let us proceed thus .
Sarah Ludford has stated that she agrees with that .
So , we vote at 5.30 p.m. on postponing the Ludford report to the next plenary session .
That is my motion .
There is absolutely no problem with that .
It is well within the Rules .
It can be done immediately before the vote .
It is normal procedure .
That is why I cannot take it now .
The Rules say you move postponement before the vote on the matter .
That concludes the votes .
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Graefe zu Baringdorf report ( A5-0044 / 2000 )
We need to pay close attention to the issue of animal health , particularly that of bovine animals and swine , hence the importance of sanitary inspections in intra-Community trade in these species .
This approach must also take account of the need to put more effort into the total eradication of diseases like leucosis , tuberculosis and brucellosis , and into adequate health procedures .
So it is essential that intervention in future makes it possible to protect both the interests of consumers and the interests of producers , especially of small farmers .
Ferrer report ( A5-0066 / 2000 )
- ( DA ) We cannot vote in favour of the report since there are gross abuses of human rights in Mexico .
That has most recently been demonstrated in an Amnesty report from December 1999 which draws attention to , among other things , the serious problems in the Chiapas region .
A democracy clause was also built into the old trade agreement with Mexico , but this was not complied with .
Pressure must therefore be exerted upon Mexico through international organisations such as the UN and via individual nations .
Only after that , and when there have been significant improvements in the area of human rights , do we think that we can enter into a new trade agreement with Mexico .
- ( FR ) At its meeting of 7 May 1999 , the European Parliament adopted the EU-Mexico Global Agreement even though none of its Members knew the terms of negotiation of its trade aspects .
The association agreement was designed to serve the interests of the large transnational firms on either side of the Atlantic , as shown by the wording of its Title IV , which refers to capital movements and related payments .
Under the heading of trade , we find a repeat of several of the most dangerous points of the MAI ( Multilateral Agreement on Investments ) .
For all those reasons , we shall vote against ratifying this agreement .
Never before has Mexico made so many concessions to a much stronger trading partner as it is now making to the European Union .
The impact on Mexico cannot be quantified , although the NAFTA agreement has already resulted in the impoverishment of large sections of the Mexican population and the demise of small undertakings .
The rules of the agreement on which we have voted go even further than those of the NAFTA agreement .
For example , the liberalisation of investments which is championed covers all sectors of the economy .
In other words it is a mini-MAI .
The drop in the standard of living and the inequalities between the European Union and Mexico which already exist will be exacerbated yet further .
It is obvious that the European side , especially Europe ' s large corporate groups , will profit from the agreement with Mexico .
It is a gift to large-scale European industry .
However , it will do nothing to improve the living and working conditions of the Mexicans , on the contrary .
There is no mention in the agreement of employee rights or social standards .
It contradicts development policy objectives and for this reason among others Mexican NGOs and other parties have asked their Senate not to sign this agreement .
The EU is trying to use individual agreements with developing and newly-industrialised countries in order to implement what it failed to achieve at the WTO conference of ministers in Seattle , partly due to the resistance of developing countries .
Its main objective in the present case is to gain access to the lucrative NAFTA area via Mexico .
The living conditions of the people have been disregarded .
This agreement does not bring about the progress needed in relations between Europe and Mexico , nor is it a suitable model for similar agreements to be concluded in the future , for example with Mercosur .
Agreements with developing countries must serve their interests first and foremost , not the interests of European corporate groups .
Joint resolution on the annual legislative programme
Mr President , I want to give the explanation on behalf of the Liberal Group in respect of the Commission 's legislative programme .
Having put this marker down for this time , in the future we would like to see the process reviewed so that it amounts to more than just ourselves as a Parliament swapping lists with the Commission .
We want something more substantial and meaningful .
- ( FR ) We voted against the joint motion for a resolution because it means granting a full discharge to the European Commission in advance and we disapprove of that in terms of both form and content .
Duff / Voggenhuber report ( A5-0064 / 2000 )
Mr President , we heard many speakers from the federalist majority of this Parliament say here yesterday that the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights under preparation would give a big boost to citizens ' rights .
However , the conditions under which this initiative was put forward tend more to reflect contempt for the life of the citizens and give us cause for serious concern about what will happen next .
First of all , a few months ago , we discovered , tucked away in the Cologne conclusions , in paragraphs 44 and 45 , the decision to start drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Who was consulted beforehand ?
No one , and certainly not the national parliaments , who had never heard of it .
All the same , however , we must remember that basically fundamental rights come within the remit of the national parliaments and , as a whole , of the various peoples of Europe .
In any case , whatever its final form , the national parliaments should not have been sidelined .
They are now involved in the Convention to draft the Charter , but only as one partner among others , which will guarantee an imperfect job .
Worse still , they will not even be involved in the final stage , since the Cologne conclusions provide that the Charter will be proclaimed jointly by the Council , the European Parliament and the Commission .
Yes , I did say " the Commission " .
So the national parliaments find themselves sidelined and replaced by a body of officials who will ' proclaim the Charter ' .
That is quite ludicrous !
Democracy is sidelined , supposedly for the good of the citizens .
But then is that not how Europe usually works ?
Mr President , I voted for the report despite many misgivings because it included Mrs Morgan ' s excellent proposed amendment on minority languages and cultures .
I would also like to have seen support for Mr Vidal ' s proposal .
But I think that we have taken an important step here towards greater protection of minorities traditionally present in the European Union .
We cannot keep setting criteria for candidate countries which we fail to meet ourselves .
A European constitution could provide the initial impetus for a superstate of this kind .
I have , therefore , supported a number of amendments tabled by the UEN Group and the EDD Group with regard to the Duff-Voggenhuber report .
If the parties of the TDI Group had taken a consistent line on the equivalence of all people and on democracy , I would certainly have supported their amendments .
However , I had to consider their view of the world in my deliberations . Of all the groups represented here , it is their view that takes least account of equivalence , democracy and human rights .
This is why I was unable to support their proposals .
Mr President , this week Parliament has dealt with the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights and we have specified - adequately I believe - the civil rights of individuals .
In this increasingly global world , some people want to impose homogeneity on us , as if we were all soldiers or units in a production chain .
So I want to claim the right to an individual and collective identity , the right to diversity and difference .
That is definitely a fundamental right worth defending in the European Union .
- ( DA ) The Danish and Swedish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the report by Mr Andrew Nicholas Duff and Mr Johannes Voggenhuber regarding drawing up a European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We are in favour of the drawing up of a Charter of Fundamental Rights in the form of a political document .
In this period of reforms of the EU , including its enlargement , it is important to focus upon the fact that the EU ' s raison d ' être is to protect individual citizens .
A Charter could make a positive contribution to this .
In drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights , there is always a certain danger of citizens ' viewing it simply as a meaningless piece of paper , to be waved on state occasions but destined to disappoint .
A majority of the European Parliament is therefore calling for the Charter to be of binding effect and to be incorporated into the Treaty , in other words for the agenda of the current Intergovernmental Conference to be extended .
In connection with previous votes on this subject , we have clearly expressed our view that there should be no more issues on the agenda than it will be possible to resolve at the Nice Summit in December .
We have already emphasised that no more obstacles should be put in the way of enlargement of the Union .
It is therefore unrealistic to expect the issues to have been resolved by December .
For that reason alone , we do not think that fundamental rights should be on the agenda of the current Intergovernmental Conference .
We have made this known in the individual votes en route to the report .
It is therefore a matter of urgency that the Nice Summit should be able to make decisions concerning the Amsterdam leftovers .
The Charter is an expression of the EU ' s ambition to bring the EU closer to its citizens .
Our point of departure is that the work on reviewing the treaties must progress following the Nice Summit and that the EU ' s Charter of Fundamental Rights should form part of this on-going process .
- ( DA ) The European Parliament ' s report on the Charter is characterised by one pervasive idea : the desire for EU citizenship in a supranational State , whether one likes that term or not .
This way of thinking is fundamentally different from our own vision of a European Community .
The Union is , and should remain , a union of States .
It must therefore be ensured that the Charter does not in any way interfere with the Member States ' national constitutions or equivalent arrangements for establishing fundamental rights .
Moreover , we do not wish to see two sets of rights on the European continent - one for citizens of EU countries and another for citizens of non-EU countries .
It is therefore crucial for any EU Charter not to affect existing international conventions and declarations of rights , but merely to require that EU countries sign these .
Growing problems arise when the EU acquires more and more powers as a State but cannot be bound in relation to , for example , the European Convention on Human Rights .
Nor do we support the constitutional process of which the adoption of a Charter is an integral part .
We prefer the Treaty to state that the EU ' s authorities respect the competence and decisions of the Court of Human Rights .
Legal practice of this kind makes it possible to condemn an aspect of Community law which is open to criticism and which has arisen through a Member State ' s use of that law .
The European Court of Justice should not have jurisdiction over areas already covered by the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg or by other international bodies .
If the existing conventions are found to be inadequate , for example , because bio-technological developments give rise to new problems , then this is an international problem to which international solutions should be sought .
It is not solely a concern of the EU , and we must seek international and global consensus in international forums .
We are therefore voting against the whole report .
- ( FR ) Our abstention from the vote on the Charter certainly does not mean we are opposed to its European character .
On the contrary , we are persuaded that in future we shall see a Europe without frontiers between unified nations , from one end of the continent to the other .
However , the European institutions , like the national institutions , tend far more to represent the interests of big capital than the interests of the people as a whole , and especially of the working people .
Democratic rights and freedoms , like democracy itself , can only be genuinely expressed so long as they do not conflict with the interests of large industrial and financial groups .
That Charter will be a vital step towards the political deepening of the European Union , under the appropriate conditions .
These people need a document to which they can refer when they take their case before the European Court of Justice .
So we must provide for direct resort to that Court in accordance with certain procedures .
As the representative of the people of the European Union , our Parliament must take a very careful look at the contents of this document .
The people of Europe expect us to take a very bold approach here .
Our demands are quite clear .
The Charter must have fully binding legal status by being incorporated in the Treaty .
To that end , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs calls on the Council to put the Charter on the ICG agenda .
Any amendment of the Charter must come under the same procedure as its original drafting procedure , which means it would require the assent of the European Parliament .
The European Parliament must approve any secondary legislation that might have a bearing on these fundamental rights .
The Charter must be binding upon the Member States when applying or transposing provisions of Community law .
Turning to the actual content of the Charter , it would seem advisable to divide up these rights into three categories .
Let me conclude by saying that this Charter must form the key component of a process leading to the drafting of a European Union constitution .
We need more time and debate on these potential conflicts .
We welcome such a Charter of Fundamental Rights which can also , of course , include rights under existing international conventions signed by the Member States .
At the same time , human rights must be regarded as an international and global issue and not only as a matter for EU citizens .
We are , however , hesitant about making such a Charter legally binding before it has been fully clarified what that would mean in practice .
The relationship between the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights appears , for example , to be legally complicated and could undermine the European Convention on Human Rights .
We believe that there are a number of questions which ought to be investigated before one particular model is opted for exclusively .
We are therefore abstaining from voting in the final vote .
- This report confirms our worst fears about the intentions of some people in relation to the Charter and that is why we have voted against it .
We are not voting against a Charter itself , but so far the process seems to suggest a wasted opportunity to protect the citizens of Europe from the overburdening powers of the European Institutions .
There is a gap to be filled in providing fundamental rights to citizens of the Member States concerning European regulation and legislation .
This report turns its back on this need and thereby devalues the potential of the Charter .
We prefer a different approach , under which economic aspects must always come second to the satisfaction of human and environmental needs .
A Charter of this kind should be based on the most progressive acquis and combine social and democratic rights .
A Charter of that kind would offer support to all those men and women who are fighting against a Europe that lays off workers or expels immigrants who do not have the proper identity papers .
I do not take the view that this charter should contain enforceable economic and social rights .
These are subject to the employment law of the Member States and the autonomy of the social partners .
- ( SV ) We welcome the work which has now begun on preparing an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
A Charter of this kind will have a very important symbolic value and will strengthen the confidence of our citizens in the EU and in European integration .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights should be seen as complementing the European Convention on Human Rights , which we believe should be incorporated into the Treaty .
The Charter should concentrate on the relationship between citizens and the European institutions . Its primary objective should be to guarantee that the Union is governed openly .
We would emphasise the subsidiarity principle and the fact that the Charter should concentrate on the fundamental freedoms and rights of citizens , as presented in accordance with the Member States ' common constitutional traditions .
We would emphasise the importance of the social dimension in the EU ' s activities but consider that social policy is mainly a question for each individual Member State to decide upon .
- ( FR ) The Charter of Fundamental Rights is the latest manifestation of the drift of Community legislation towards a constitution .
Yet what worries me most is the content that is to be given to these rights .
Indeed , at this same part-session we are discussing reports by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms which reflect a libertarian vision of society .
Our society will no longer have a common destiny ; instead it will be based on a juxtaposition of ' minorities ' which each have their own rights but no common obligation .
The conclusion I draw from these texts is that the just fight for human rights has become the ideological plaything of irresponsible and selfish individuals .
- British Labour Members fully support a Charter of Fundamental Rights which makes visible citizens ' rights across the EU .
However , we are at a very early stage in the process of determining the Charter .
It is therefore too early to say what should be legally binding .
This decision will be made at a later stage as recognised by the report itself in Paragraph 6 .
That Paragraph also states that any legally binding status recognises that Fundamental Rights are indivisible by making the Charter applicable to all the European Union 's institutions and bodies and all its policies .
This is a recognisable aim which British Labour Members would support .
As the final Charter text is not available , we are supporting the Charter in principle but awaiting the final version .
This is a complex process which needs clarity and precision at all stages to ensure that the end result is a positive and visible step forward for people in all EU countries .
- ( DA ) The European Union rests upon fundamental principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights .
In my view , a declaration would be more appropriate .
The European Convention on Human Rights is an excellent tool for protecting human rights in Europe .
It involves enforcing these rights on the basis of judgements given by the Court of Human Rights , which has developed considerable expertise in this area , as well as extensive case law .
The Convention also has the advantage of not being limited in scope to the area of the EU but of operating in relation to almost the whole of the European continent .
At the same time , it is the European Court of Justice ' s practice to take account of the national fundamental rights applicable in the Member States .
This practice could be affected if the EU were to obtain its own set of fundamental and human rights .
Jackson resolution ( B5-0227 / 2000 )
My Group voted in favour of the Jackson resolution on Structural Funds in the environment because we believe in the principle of ensuring effective implementation of environmental law - in this case , the wild birds and habitats directive .
However , we are surprised that Members of this House voted for the original proposal in paragraph 7 to cut off funds to some of our poorest regions in the EU .
Indeed , the Commissioner , in a response to the debate , said she would not be stopping approval of key funding programmes .
I therefore welcome the fact that this House voted by a majority against cutting off resources .
The Commissioner would , in any case , have had no legal competence to stop approval and therefore I am glad that , at the end of the day , common sense has prevailed in our vote .
- ( DE ) It would appear that Community environmental protection does not have its own lobby at the Community institutions .
There is no other explanation as to why the Commission gave way yesterday and suddenly decided to reinterpret the Structural Funds regulation .
That was unnecessary in that the regulation fully covered the Commission ' s demand for FFH lists to be submitted together with the plans at the latest and per se leaves the Commission no room for manoeuvre here .
The Structural Funds regulation also states that this ex-ante evaluation should include an assessment of the environmental situation , especially in areas which might be influenced by Structural Fund intervention .
The Commission is therefore duty bound to ensure that the documents notify it of potential areas subject to European nature conservation before it approves the plans .
The Commission is deluding itself if it thinks that it can use Article 39 to recoup what it has failed to obtain during ex-ante evaluation .
How can the Commission be credible vis-à-vis the European citizens if it is unable to implement its own requirements ?
By giving in , the Commission has lost the confidence of many who see sustainable development as a chance for the next generation .
- ( FR ) The French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group are very concerned with preserving the natural heritage in general and the environmentally sensitive areas in particular .
We share the desire to protect an environment which it is our duty to pass on intact to our children .
That is a laudable and necessary ambition .
The only result of this kind of overload is to paralyse the economic players a little more each day and to hold back freedom of enterprise .
We therefore categorically reject Mrs Jackson ' s proposal to link payments from the Structural Funds to the transposing by Member States of EU environmental legislation .
Malmström report ( A5-0060 / 2000 )
Mr President , I would like , as a matter of priority , to thank Parliament for lending its support to aid for Mongolia .
I hope this will lead to a much more proactive approach on the part of the Commission , as I have not seen a sign of this yet .
It may not occupy centre stage but is very needy despite this .
This Parliament has noticed this and offered its support , and I urge the Commission to take this message extremely seriously and to grant this aid .
Within the European Union , one of the fundamental rights of man , the right to make an adequate living from his labour , is being trampled underfoot for nearly 20 million men and women .
A fairly substantial proportion of immigrant workers , those regarded as not having the proper papers , is being deprived of any legal existence .
All the while , outside the European Union , several of its Member States , among the most powerful of them , are supporting , arming and financing vile dictatorships , especially in their former colonial empire .
And what about that manifestation of respect for human rights that took the form , for several weeks , of bombing Kosovo and Serbia ?
Under these circumstances , we are abstaining from the vote on this report .
As you know , the EU ' s international action to promote and protect human rights is based on several instruments , including the CFSP and development cooperation .
With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the European Union has become more visible on the international stage thanks to the appointment of a CFSP High Representative , in the person of Javier Solana .
The Treaty of Amsterdam has made respect for human rights one of the main objectives of the EU ' s common foreign and security policy .
The European Union has many instruments available in this field .
There are also specific and horizontal actions relating to a given policy . They include , in particular , the fight to abolish the death penalty .
This clause does not change the fundamental nature of these agreements but does enable both parties to reaffirm respect for certain common values and principles as the precondition for any form of cooperation , economic or other .
Yet the rapporteur feels that the current European human rights policy is fragmented and needs to be replaced by a coherent common strategy marked by closer interinstitutional cooperation .
Obviously I agree with that .
The report also emphasises that the EU strategy must give priority to systematically abolishing the discrimination suffered by women .
I want to express my unconditional support for that demand !
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted against Amendment No 7 because we do not feel that a reference to the supposed ' Echelon ' network is appropriate to this report .
Allegations that such an ' Echelon network ' exists are based on hearsay and circumstantial evidence .
Furthermore , the democratic oversight of national intelligence services is , in any case , primarily a matter for national parliaments .
The United Kingdom has one of the most effective systems of democratic oversight , both political and judicial , of its intelligence services in the world .
Political oversight is exercised by a House of Commons committee , which has full access to documentation .
Moreover , the intelligence operations of third countries , including the United States , operating in cooperation with British intelligence services within the United Kingdom , are also subject to the same democratic oversight .
- British Conservatives are in the forefront of those seeking to improve human rights in many parts of the world .
While there is much in the Malmström resolution that we can support , unfortunately there are significant elements that have been included which we find unacceptable .
For example , we do not share the enthusiasm for an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
We are sceptical about demands for substantial increases in expenditure and bureaucratic activity and in the role of EC-funded NGOs .
We are concerned that it is minority differences that are stimulated , with little emphasis on integration .
We are concerned at the extension of the concept of human rights to include , for example , domestic violence , which is properly a matter to be handled under other legal instruments .
We are opposed to the introduction of sweeping new categories of eligibility for asylum , which would be open to abuse .
Many of us do not support the abolition of capital punishment in principle .
And we are suspicious about proposals to impose further codes of conduct on business .
It is for these reasons that British Conservatives have voted against the Malmström resolution .
Haarder report ( A5-0050 / 2000 )
The supporters of that theory should get their act together .
Mr President , I should like to follow on from what Mrs Lulling has just said .
I should like to say that Mr Haarder has made an exemplary effort to bring about a consensus .
As a result , his report was far better than all the previous reports .
The German constitution offers marriage and the family special protection and that has nothing to do with the violation of human rights .
On the contrary , it is a guarantee of human rights .
Marriage and the family form the basis for human rights , as does the right to life .
I therefore believe that these points should have been left out of the human rights report .
If they had , the House would have voted unanimously in favour of this human rights report because , apart from that , Mr Haarder has presented an exemplary piece of work .
Mr President , I note with some surprise that I am bringing up the rear , despite having been the first to request the floor in writing .
Secondly , I should also like to note that , broadly speaking , my Group supports the Haarder report and expressly highlights the fact that there was excellent cooperation with the rapporteur .
At last we have before us a report which duly deals with the subject , the stated period and enforceable rights .
Hence our support in principle .
I am therefore able to tell the House that both Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen have valid passports without any form of restriction .
The call on Austria to take action in relation to freedom of movement is therefore devoid of any substance .
- ( FR ) In adopting the Haarder report on human rights in the European Union , the European Parliament has just committed one of those aberrations that are so common they must be part of its nature .
Among others , it is calling for equal rights of all kinds between same-sex couples and the traditional family , together with lowering the age of consent for same-sex relations .
That same article defines the family in terms of the marriage between a man and a woman .
That service is a very good reason for granting the family special advantages , reserved to it alone .
By ignoring that vital law , the Haarder report shows that in this respect , as in many others , the European instruments go against not only the nations but also against society itself .
- ( DA ) We support the general recommendations in the report to the Member States regarding compliance with the international conventions on human rights .
We are not in favour of the new institutional arrangements proposed in the report or in favour of the proposal that the EU should establish a common legal framework and a common policy on refugees and asylum seekers .
An EU Charter of Fundamental Rights would not in itself help improve the human situation , either at European or international level .
We have , however , chosen to vote in favour of the report in spite of what I have just said , for we think it is extremely important to fight for improved human rights in Europe .
This is an issue which requires deeper analysis .
Overlapping and conflicts between the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the European Court of Human Rights should , in any event , be avoided .
- I believe that this is a good report and deserves support .
However , problems arise in the detail of paragraphs 52 , 53 , 54 and 56 . I voted for these paragraphs because I agree with the objectives of the rapporteur .
I would , however , like to ensure that my voting intentions are not misinterpreted .
In relation to paragraph 52 I support the right of individual conscience .
In stating this principle I would also like to make it absolutely clear that this in no way implies that I personally support abortion .
With regard to paragraphs 53 , 54 and 56 I oppose discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation .
I would , however , add a few caveats .
Firstly , I do not support the right of gay couples to adopt .
Secondly , I do not support the lowering of the age of consent below 18 years of age .
With these clarifications entered for the record I am happy to vote for Mr Haarder 's report .
- On balance , this is an excellent report with the exception of paragraphs 52 to 56 .
This section is poorly drafted and ambiguous . It deals with issues that are firmly in the competence of each Member State , and should so remain .
Yet I would also like to draw my colleagues ' attention to two requests made in the report , which I find problematic .
Paragraph 19 of the report , concerning the protection of national minorities , and paragraph 20 , calling for the ratification of the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages , pose real problems .
Parliament firmly rejects abuses of fundamental freedoms throughout Europe , as the Haarder report emphasises .
But we regret that it alludes to the rights of ' national minorities ' , an expression that is far more restrictive than the universal concept of ' human rights ' .
Furthermore , we support the idea of an indivisible political community , within which ethnic origin is not eclipsed but regarded as being of secondary importance .
The Republic cannot recognise specific ' minorities ' or ' communities ' : in its view there are only autonomous and free citizens with equal rights .
In view of our convictions we must also express strong reservations about paragraph 20 of the report , which refers to the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages .
Everyone is free to use one or several languages of his or her choice in addition to the language of the Republic and everyone has the right to learn them at school .
But the fact remains that this is a choice and not an obligation .
I will , nevertheless , vote for Mr Haarder ' s report because of its quality and its underlying philosophy .
It is not the primary function of this parliament to produce extensive and controversial additions to current legislation and extra channels of redress on an assumption that these should automatically be acceptable simply because they have been proposed .
All of us want human rights to be uppermost in the minds of national and European legislators .
In most cases they are .
- ( EL ) Once more , the hypocrisy of the European Union is evident both in the state of , and respect for , human rights within the Union and in its international policy on these matters .
The European Union turns a blind eye to situations in which human rights are being savagely violated in order to protect its imperialistic interests .
Its attitude towards the Turkish regime is a blatant example .
Elsewhere , the particularly sensitive issue of human rights is being used as an excuse for intervention , even military intervention , so as to impose specific policies and particular courses of action .
The very policy which the EU and its Member States are pursuing from within is leading to human rights being subverted and becoming dead letter .
The effects of this policy are already visible in the rise of extremist , fascist powers and racist perceptions , and not just in Austria .
The report on combating racism does not demonstrate that the necessary conclusions have been reached .
We therefore condemn the EU ' s attempts to use human rights as a pretext in order to reinforce its anti-grass roots and anti-democratic nature and intervene further to the detriment of the people .
We call on the people to be vigilant and to stop their self-proclaimed saviours trampling on their rights .
We also urge them to fight for solutions which will guarantee that their rights are promoted and flourish .
For these reasons , the three Members of the European Parliament of the Greek Communist Party will abstain from voting .
- ( FR ) I want to draw a parallel between the reports by Mrs Ludford and Mr Haarder and the report by Messrs Duff and Voggenhuber .
The European Parliament is proposing to take part in drafting a European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
And why not ?
Nonetheless , we cannot see how this additional document can contribute to the fight for human rights , except by injecting a little more legal confusion .
And , above all , what are we to think of our House ' s concept of these rights ?
We can get an initial sketchy idea from reading the Ludford and Haarder reports : this is a project for a libertarian society , based on rights without obligations , on freedom without responsibilities .
Freedom is not something that can be decreed .
Man cannot be regarded as an entity independent of those around him and concerned solely with his immediate well-being .
The human being not only needs to be given the means to live , but also , and above all , he needs the reasons to live .
An additional charter , European or not , will certainly not provide them .
- ( NL ) We have consented to the Haarder report but would like to make the following observations regarding paragraphs 19 and 20 of the draft report .
Paragraph 19 urges Belgium to sign the Convention for national minorities .
In the Belgian federation , the federal states are equal pursuant to the rules in the constitution .
Not one of them constitutes an actual minority .
Moreover , French-speakers living in the periphery , which boasts the language facilities , can count on protection , which is mostly unavailable to real minorities .
Without a doubt , French-speaking Belgian MEPs will again use this vote to play political games in Belgium .
We do not wish to participate in this and would emphatically disassociate ourselves from this kind of practice .
Moreover , we regret that in paragraph 5 of the Ludford report , the same text was adopted for racism and xenophobia .
We must fight against pornography , against increasingly widespread child abuse , against male and female prostitution and against sex tourism , which inevitably leads to suffering on the part of children .
- ( FR ) I want to explain the reasons underlying my rejection of the annual report on respect for human rights in the European Union .
On the contrary , recent history has shown how the exacerbation of the sense of belonging to a particular community can trigger the resurgence of ancient ethnic disputes and lead to fratricidal conflicts .
Rather than this concept , I prefer the universalist vision of a republican Europe in which each individual as such fully and actively exercises his rights and freedoms .
The Republic of Europe remains to be built : let us hope that the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is still at the drafting stage , will constitute the first act and the cornerstone of that Europe .
For the same reasons , I abstained on the report on the fight against racism and xenophobia in the European Union .
.
- ( FR ) The annual report on respect for human rights in the European Union is usually taken as an opportunity to display a rather pathetic excess of political correctness .
The champions of the libertarian ideology never miss the chance to list a whole series of demands , each more ludicrous than the next , all wrapped up in proper sentiments .
Perhaps that is what this whole exercise demands .
Alas , the 2000 vintage still goes along with this curious tradition .
As a member of the Committee on Women ' s Rights , I shall confine myself to emphasising the equality between men and women on the one hand , and the importance of the family on the other .
We therefore categorically reject any policy of quotas or positive discrimination , those pet themes of political correctness .
This role has been downgraded for far too long , although it is a key role .
How many of them have been forced to devote more time to their professional life than they would have wished ?
That kind of policy would mean giving the family its due place .
But this report is an extremely dangerous all-out attack on the family .
It calls for equal rights for same-sex couples and traditional couples and families , forgetting the vital role the family plays in social cohesion .
Let us make no mistake : everyone leads the private life they want ; there can be no question of secret policing .
The family , on the contrary , is the community on which society is based and that ensures its stability .
Its utility resides in the fact that it provides the most stable framework possible for creating new generations , for their education , and therefore for the continuity of mankind .
Even now , with the strong backing of certain European resolutions and under pressure from action groups , there are some who are preparing to recognise the right of same-sex couples to adopt children .
Just imagine the psychological future of children with two fathers and no mother , or two mothers and no father !
If it is to fulfil its potential , a child needs a father and a mother , a stable family .
In face of the culture of death , it is our duty to stand up for the culture of life .
We believe in an exalted idea of the dignity of man , whoever he may be , without discrimination , from the moment of conception to his natural death .
That means breaking with the materialistic and individualistic view of man and believing that there is something sacred in each individual , which is the foundation of human dignity .
Man is neither a social security number nor a pawn on a social and economic chessboard to be manipulated at will and discarded when no longer of use .
He is worth much more than that : every man is a sacred history .
That concludes the explanations of vote .
( The sitting was adjourned at 2.11 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Topical and urgent debate
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Western Sahara
The next item is the debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0246 / 2000 by Mrs González Álvarez and others on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left ;
B5-0253 / 2000 by Mr Sánchez García and others on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party ;
B5-0262 / 2000 by Mr Carnero González and others on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists ;
B5-0272 / 2000 by Mrs Schröder and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance ;
B5-0278 / 2000 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez Neyra and others on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats
on the Western Sahara .
They have released prisoners and accepted the United Nations rulings on eligible voters .
It is the Moroccan Government that has been putting obstacles in the way of resolving the conflict .
If obstacles continue to be put in the way , we may be responsible for a more serious conflict .
Some people are shocked that the Sahrawi people are now saying they are left with no alternative but to take up arms again .
I am not shocked . I can understand it .
It is a solution nobody wants , of course , but it is one we are forcing them into .
Mr President , the European Union - and Parliament within it , of course - must strive to avoid a new conflict in an area which is already troubled enough .
We do not want Western Sahara to become another East Timor , Mr President ,
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are circumstances which make Western Sahara a highly topical issue and they are relevant this evening .
Mention must be made of serious incidents which have recently occurred in the occupied territories of Western Sahara , where pro-referendum demonstrations have been suppressed by the Moroccan authorities .
The instability that could become endemic in this part of Africa could affect some of the outermost Community regions , like my region , the Canary Islands .
Our citizens want a peaceful solution to the conflict in Western Sahara and they want the Sahrawi people to hold the referendum under conditions of freedom , transparency and equality .
And finally , one of the objectives of the European Union ' s common foreign and security policy is the maintenance of peace and the strengthening of international security .
That is why we support the motion for a resolution .
Mr President , first we must express our concern for the Sahrawi people , many of whom have experienced long years of exile and suffering .
Solving their problem means respecting the deadlines for holding the referendum that has been postponed again and again .
If there were to be another postponement it would seriously aggravate the problem .
Stability , security and peace in the Maghreb region depend on this referendum taking place .
On the proper conclusion of this process of self-determination depend the stability , peace and indeed the economic integration and development of the whole Maghreb .
I would even say that the transition to full democracy apparently under way in the Kingdom of Morocco also depends on it .
From our point of view , the culmination of the process of self-determination in Western Sahara lies in the application of the peace plan from the United Nations and the Organisation for African Unity .
And the core of that peace plan is precisely the holding of a free and fair referendum on self-determination , in which voters can make their choice without any kind of pressure .
In spite of the efforts of the United Nations , in spite of MINURSO , in spite of the progress that has been made in compiling the electoral roll , the referendum keeps being postponed virtually sine die .
Of course , the delay of the referendum is essentially the responsibility of one of the parties , which is failing to finalise acceptance of the terms under which the said referendum is to take place .
The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front must restore the direct dialogue which existed at the end of the 1980 ' s and which led to the Houston Agreements .
The European Union should make it a priority to help keep that process going , to help it succeed .
Regrettably , the Union has not acted in the most appropriate way up to now .
Much has been said , but little has actually been done .
That is how we can contribute to achieving a priority objective : peace in the Maghreb .
Self-determination in Western Sahara is essential for that .
Mr President , I should like on behalf of my Group to voice our serious concern at the current situation in the Western Sahara to the European Parliament and , more importantly , the Commission and the Council .
The constant postponement of the referendum on the future of the Western Sahara is unacceptable .
A state of emergency reins in the occupied areas .
At least 56 people have been arrested , including 27 women , for fighting for the right to self-determination .
We call on the government of Morocco to stop repression , lift the state of emergency and permit freedom of expression .
We call on the Council of the EU to vote on joint action which will enable the peace plan to be duly implemented without delay .
The previous involvement of the personal envoy of the UN Secretary General , Mr James Baker , should be used for further mediation work in a bid to implement UN Security Council Resolution No 1292 / 2000 .
We urge the Commission of the EU to ensure immediately that the people in the refugee camps have a secure supply of food .
The supply situation has deteriorated dramatically .
All the stocks of basic foodstuffs have been used up .
According to information from various NGOs , food has been rationed since December and various countries have withdrawn bilateral aid .
The World Food Programme relies on the EU ; as a result , ECHO must now provide 80 % of the food aid originally intended as supplementary aid .
The Council and the Commission must therefore immediately exert pressure on the UN to improve the food situation .
The Commission must set up a financial safety fund for the next three months .
Is it right that , due to staff problems at ECHO and the lack of a new global plan , no food aid is being supplied at present ?
Anything approved today will not be implemented until next August at the earliest , but people cannot be left without aid for such a long period unless they are supposed to starve to death .
We had a similarly dramatic situation a year ago in East Timor .
A referendum was held .
A state of emergency followed .
Only then did international aid react ; no preventative action was taken in order to avoid conflict .
That is why we call on the Commission and the Council to act before it is too late .
Mr President , to begin with , I want to agree with most of what has been said in this regard , especially by my colleague , Mrs González Álvarez .
I also want to take the opportunity to appeal to the Council .
As I understand it , Portugal does not intend , during its presidency , to take any initiatives on this issue .
I am also particularly glad that Commissioner Nielson is present here today .
ECHO has assumed the major responsibility of constantly providing for the refugees and , whenever this organisation wavers , the voluntary organisations are left powerless .
They have ceased to provide aid and there is no effective coordination .
I really would appeal to Commissioner Nielson to act quickly . I would also appeal to the chairman and members of the Committee on Budgets to deal with this issue quickly .
I cannot think of anything worse than languishing for 25 years among the sand dunes and being taken in by referenda year upon year , only then to starve to death .
Mr President , the Western Sahara issue is , unfortunately , familiar .
It is one of the few legacies of colonialism still surviving in the year 2000 . Morocco is not complying with the United Nations resolutions .
A referendum should have been held years ago , as it was in other countries such as East Timor , Latvia and other places where the right to self-determination has been exercised .
The position of the European Parliament has always been to support , not the independence of the Sahrawi , but the right of the Sahrawi people to freely express their views .
Even today , this right is still being suppressed , under various different pretexts .
Meanwhile , the situation of the Sahrawi people has become serious : even their physical survival is under threat .
Mr President , the peace process in the Western Sahara initiated and led by the Secretary-General of the United Nations looked promising .
The eligible voters were identified thanks to the effective UN mission , MINURSO .
But the Moroccan Government has artificially stepped up the number of appeals concerning voters , a clear sign that it wants to prevent the holding of the referendum on self-determination .
The United Nations must do its utmost to ensure that the referendum is held before the end of 2000 .
The Commission is closely following developments in the implementation of the UN Security Council ' s plan to settle the Western Sahara conflict .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Mozambique
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0244 / 2000 by Mr Miranda and others on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left ;
B5-0251 / 2000 by Mr Queiró and Mr Ribeiro i Castro on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group ;
B5-0254 / 2000 by Mr van den Bos on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party ;
B5-0263 / 2000 by Mrs Carrilho and others on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists ;
B5-0276 / 2000 by Mr Rod and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance ;
B5-0279 / 2000 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and others on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats
on the floods in Mozambique .
It is equally important that all the countries cancel Mozambique ' s debt in full so as to facilitate its recovery .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in our mind ' s eye we can still see the tragic pictures from Mozambique , the results of a rare sequence of extremely harsh natural events .
We are also very much aware of how slow the response to this massive disaster has been .
We regard the resolution we will be voting on today as the continuation of an emergency debate which took place at the mini-session in Brussels immediately following these events .
But we alone should not bear the blame for the delay .
We should also be wondering what other countries in other continents are doing .
What about India and Pakistan , which have substantial resources and large communities resident in Mozambique ?
And what are the nearby African countries doing ?
Angola , for example , has powerful armed forces which could have given valuable assistance , or Zimbabwe , just next door , or Nigeria , which has an operational air force .
These questions must also be asked given the imminence of the approaching European Union / Africa Summit , so that we can communicate better on this issue out of common concern for solidarity .
I must also say that we are sensitive to the issue of external debt forgiveness , but we identify more with the text set out in the joint resolution .
As a Christian Democrat , I am sensitive to the appeals of the Catholic Church in this jubilee year for positive handling of the external debt of the third world as a whole .
But we need to make a distinction between the different situations of many African countries .
There are cases where the fortunes accumulated by the leaders of these countries would be enough to pay off their external debt , so these are sensitive issues which need to be carefully considered .
We know this is not the situation in Mozambique , as poor as the country may be .
Mr President , the media have portrayed a distorted image of the disaster which struck Mozambique .
Whilst the world witnessed scenes of desperate people on rooftops and in trees , aid had already got under way off camera .
At least gripping images have a mobilising effect on public opinion and provide a strong base for aid .
But the other side of the coin is that disasters which do not reach the news , to all intents and purposes , do not exist .
This is why it is essential that international aid is not led by the media but only by the people in need .
According to the organisations involved , despite everything , aid has got under way relatively quickly .
This may be true , but this does not apply to the primary rescue operations .
It was not the Commission which was responsible for this , but the governments .
Aircraft , helicopters , food and medicine must be available on demand and at a moment ' s notice .
And I mean literally at a moment ' s notice .
The waiting period should only be determined by the distance involved , not the red tape .
There is a need for much better cooperation between the aid organisations and the armed forces to this end .
It is commendable that Commissioner Nielson travelled to Mozambique so quickly .
I would be interested to hear about his trip and what he thinks of the criticism of the government ?
And what about the criticism concerning coordination ?
The 25 million aid package is sufficient for now , but will need to be increased at a later date .
Mozambique has now entered an extremely difficult phase .
Diseases must be kept at bay , the landmines littering the area must be cleared and re-housing schemes must be established .
For many Mozambicans , the misery is only just starting , now that the media have packed up and moved on .
It is therefore up to us , Parliament , the Council and the Commission , to closely monitor the victims ourselves .
For days there were only seven helicopters trying to bring those people the aid they need , while governments remained silent and the whole world looked on , anguished and appalled .
The European Union must never behave like this again .
In particular the Member States must cancel their share of Mozambique ' s external debt .
Mr President , the recent floods in Mozambique , followed by the hurricane , have thrown the country into complete disarray , at a time when it was just about recovering from the political atrocities of the past .
It is sad that this should happen to one of the world ' s poorest countries as well .
Unfortunately , aid got under way relatively late in the day , at least according to the reports .
Moreover , the world also witnessed how quickly South African helicopters were on the scene and how they saved a few thousand people as a result .
I think it would be fitting to pay tribute to them for these efforts .
Meanwhile , we have heard from Commissioner Nielson that a great deal more was done than was made known .
We appreciate the fact that he travelled to Mozambique in person to assess the situation and to see what the EU could do in the way of aid .
In my opinion , the programme which has now been drawn up in conjunction with the Mozambique government is a sound one , also because it is phased .
It will first address emergency aid , then housing and infrastructure and after that structural aid in order to get the affected areas back on their feet .
The funding which has been set aside for this project is considerable .
I have heard that the international community has put one hundred million on the table in the meantime , and that the EU has made a disproportionate contribution to this .
Moreover , I heard this morning that debts have most definitely been deferred but that it is to be examined how this will be dealt with in future .
It would be good , of course , if these debts were actually suspended , for then the Mozambique government could use the funds for this purpose .
Mr President , I am left with an uncomfortable feeling . The images which have been broadcast obviously do not reflect reality .
Mr Van den Bos has also pointed this out .
The images were inadequate , the disaster is very sad indeed , but the European Union did not stand idly by , as was suggested . We most definitely provided support .
I think it is only fair to clarify this here .
Mr President , rarely has the European Parliament devoted its attention to a natural disaster in circumstances so dramatic and so deserving of our support .
As you are aware , I visited Mozambique on 2 and 3 March , together with the Portuguese State Secretary , Mr Amado .
From the onset of the crisis the Commission has addressed the consequences of the floods in Mozambique in a comprehensive manner .
We have directed our attention to the following areas of concern : immediate relief , resettlement , rehabilitation , macro-economic stability and long-term development .
On the rescue , search and recovery phase : the situation is that the Commission does not have instruments that are geared to this type of intervention .
Member States have the logistical capacity which is needed for these kinds of activities .
For the relief emergency aid and resettlement phase , the Commission has approved two ECHO decisions for a total of EUR 2.7 m for Mozambique , and we are preparing a third decision for EUR 5.5 m .
These cover food aid , water and sanitation , essential relief items as well as the small-scale rehabilitation of essential health infrastructure and preparation for cholera epidemics .
In addition , EUR 1.4 m from the food security budget line have been made available locally to the delegation and the government of Mozambique .
The Commission is planning to fund the delivery of seeds and tools to the peasants to promote replanting as soon as the flood-waters recede .
In addition to the action already funded in Botswana , the Commission is currently carrying out a humanitarian need assessment in Zimbabwe , Zambia and Madagascar .
The Commission is insisting on the need for reinforced coordination with the government around the shared comprehensive reconstruction framework .
A donor core group is meeting every week in Maputo with the government at ministerial level .
The EU presidency and the Commission delegation are members of that group .
The Commission intends to contribute to the preparation of the international donor conference that will be convened probably by the end of April .
The Commission will provide its funding for the rehabilitation requirements in strict coordination with EU Member States and the other donors .
As to macro-economic stability and long-term development : proposals intended to help Mozambique maintain macro-economic stability are currently being appraised by the Commission with the government and the World Bank .
Additional resources , up to EUR 15 m , could be made available .
To maintain the rapid growth achieved by Mozambique in recent years , pre-disaster levels of cooperation will be maintained and stepped up .
This will result in disbursements for this purpose estimated at EUR 150 m this year as compared to EUR 100 m last year .
Within the framework of the Community we will contribute EUR 1 bn for debt relief to ACP countries .
Within this , Mozambique figures among the retroactive cases and will be eligible for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative this year .
Constraints have been identified in this terrible disaster case .
I am at present seeing how we can overcome these constraints to humanitarian assistance in order to provide assistance from the Community even more quickly and efficiently than at present .
This is not easily done .
Finally , I would like to emphasise the figures concerning the international response .
The overall figure of funding for this disaster now stands at about EUR 109 m globally , of which more than EUR 91 m come from the Commission and the EU Member States .
It has already been said in this debate that the European response has , relatively speaking , shown that Europe actually cares .
In money terms we have contributed quite well .
This is not the whole answer to the problem , and we will continue to find better and quicker ways of responding .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
We all hope that our aid really will help the people get over the worst of it .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.

Presidential elections in Peru :
Mr President , the violation of human rights in Peru is another case in the long list of cases occurring in Latin American countries with the connivance of a complacent United States .
The coming elections offer no democratic guarantees , so it is up to the European Union to act as a reference point in ensuring that the citizens of Peru and the democratic parties of that country receive those guarantees .
In view of what is going on in that country , and in Colombia , Mexico , Ecuador and elsewhere , it seems appropriate for the European Union to establish a permanent human rights observatory for Latin America .
It is not just the euro which must compete with the dollar ; our ethical and political human rights principles must replace the old backyard and gunboat policy the United States is pursuing in the area .
Mr President , Peru has had quite a troubled constitutional life with frequent incursions by the military into civilian life .
The European Parliament has already had occasion to condemn this type of action by President Fujimori .
President Fujimori has obviously re-established a degree of calm , if one can call it that , in Peru . But he has continued to keep himself in power by authoritarian means .
In fact I would say that , for many , President Fujimori is no more than the civilian representative of military power exercised indirectly .
Yes , there are still elections in Peru , there are political parties , there are means of communication and there are certain guarantees .
But the guarantees are not complete .
The proof is that three judges from the Constitutional Court were removed for opposing his re-election plans .
That means the guarantees are not complete .
There is no independence of the judiciary or of the legislature .
Secondly , Peru recently withdrew from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights , and I think that is a very bad sign for a country .
I think we should ask the Government of Peru to review that decision .
And thirdly , there is still military action going on inside Peru at this moment , frequently creating difficulties for democracy .
In this respect , the reference just now to a permanent human rights observatory for Latin America seems to me entirely appropriate .
Mr President , our primary duty in the struggle to protect the civilian population , refugees and prisoners of war in Chechnya is to do everything to finally bring the war in Chechnya to an end .
This should also be uppermost in the mind of the parliamentary delegation due to travel to the war zone over the coming weeks .
I should also like to warn against judging just one side and apportioning blame solely to the Russian side .
It is clear , including from the report by the Council of Europe delegation , that human rights have been violated and war crimes committed by all the warring factions .
They must be investigated and the guilty must be called consistently to account .
But we should also give the competent Russian authorities the chance to do this themselves .
Mr President , we had a welcome visit yesterday to this Parliament from a delegation from the CIS Parliamentary Assembly .
This gave us a unique opportunity to discuss Russia ' s war with Chechnya face-to-face with other Parliamentarians .
We responded .
Russia is a member of the Council of Europe , and even her need in terms of security to protect her citizens internally from outside assault could not absolve her from her responsibilities under international conventions .
I put the point that the containment by Russia of arms flows from Russia would be a very welcome step forward in terms of shared efforts to combat terrorism .
I suggest no sanctions , no economic sanctions against Russia should be considered at this time .
We have a duty , now that the war is almost over , to have access to victims and to give aid for rehabilitation .
Mr President , I must contradict Mr Markov quite categorically .
It is not apportioning blame to one side to talk of the genocide committed by Russia against the Chechen people , as Lord Judd does in the report by the Parliamentary Assembly delegation of the Council of Europe .
Of course , both sides are guilty of infringements , but Lord Judd ' s diagnosis is pretty unequivocal : genocide .
That is reason enough not to ask Russia to investigate infringements and war crimes .
It would be highly unusual to ask the murderer to investigate himself and we need international bodies to do this .
What we need is the international criminal court and we must bring those responsible to justice .
That is why I warn against a pseudo balanced approach .
So we need to ensure that a negotiated solution is reached with the elected representatives of the Chechen people .
We have not yet reached that point , but we did hear how Russian society is currently becoming more radical from an expert this morning .
We interceded for the release of the Russian journalist Mr Babitsky .
He was due to visit the European Parliament today and give us an eye witness account of the situation in Chechnya , but he was not allowed to leave Russia .
It is a scandal and we cannot accept it .
Freedom of the press for Russia is also a service to the Russian people .
Mr President , it would seem that a war that was started to end terrorism is turning into a situation where a new terrorism is just starting .
It seems to be becoming a permanent phenomenon in the region .
We have condemned the Russian action over the recent months in five separate resolutions .
There has been a certain amount of one-sided thinking in them here and there , which has not made them any more effective .
For example , the idea to use the TACIS programme as a sanction will only lead to ordinary people suffering and has not deterred the Russian government in their policy .
The extension of the war and terrorism is a major threat to us all .
For that reason , we need a Caucasus peace conference , because these problems are not confined to Chechnya .
Secondly , the human rights situation is intolerable , and we therefore need a proper investigation into violations of human rights by all parties .
In addition , speedy and unhindered access to the area on the part of relief organisations must be guaranteed once and for all .
Thirdly , the war must be stopped and talks begun .
And fourthly , Russia ' s active participation in the work against international terrorism and the illegal arms trade is essential .
Finally , the principal rule with respect to refugees is that they should be helped near to where they live and helped to return to their homes .
In this we recognise the short-sightedness of our own policies .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we know that Russia ' s international standing has been seriously damaged by the Chechen war .
A full investigation of human rights violations involving international observers is also in Russia ' s political interests .
Except that the Russian government does not appear to be totally convinced of the fact .
How else are we to interpret the fact that the UN envoy Mary Robinson was not granted access to Grozny and the filtration camps .
The agreement which has now been brokered with Mr Kalamanov by the human rights envoy of the Council of Europe , Gil Robles , is a step in the right direction .
But it will only continue to be credible if the two Council of Europe envoys really can work independently and move freely and independently around the country .
We reject and shall not accept any unilateral interpretation of the agreement by the Russian government .
We too are required to put a halt to the expulsion of refugees in our countries , as the German government has done .
We too are required to grant Chechens political asylum in our countries .
It would make a great deal of sense if the proposals by the German government were adopted by all the Member States .
This is a despicable war , whose prime victims are the people of Chechnya , but also the young Russian soldiers .
We are also appalled , however , at the attitude of the western powers , in particular the European ones .
The British Prime Minister ' s recent visit to Moscow , the way he toadied to the butcher-in-chief Putin , reflect the general attitude of the western powers .
What public opinion sees is a few declarations condemning certain aspects of the war in Chechnya ; what we are actually seeing is political and financial support for the Kremlin .
Any western loans that have not been hijacked by the Yeltsin clan can thus be spent on pursuing the war against Chechnya .
Many of the parties represented here in Parliament form part of governments that are pursuing this policy of conciliation and support .
Under those circumstances , the vote in Parliament can only serve as a fig-leaf for the hypocrisy of the European big powers and their profound complicity with the crimes the Russian leaders have committed in Chechnya .
Freedom of the press in Serbia :
The people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are still living in terrible conditions , battered by their own government ' s policy of homicide and suicide , NATO shelling and the embargoes of the international community .
The Serbian authorities are suppressing newspapers , independent radio stations and any radio stations which acknowledge opposition groups or parties .
Mr President , I believe that we are all of one mind today as to how this topic should be handled and the way the media are being treated in Serbia .
The situation in Yugoslavia is deteriorating by the day .
In fact , it seems as if Mr Milosevic and his friends are playing a three-way game by means of which they are trying to deregulate anything which can possibly be deregulated .
Tension surrounding Montenegro is mounting .
At Kosovo ' s border , the situation is very unsettled and the regime in Belgrade is creating a climate in which large-scale accidents are likely .
The last few weeks have been marked by a series of repressive measures against the independent media .
This ranged from high fines to direct intimidation .
In addition , there is talk of a kind of internal isolation .
It is increasingly difficult to enter the country .
I experienced this myself a couple of weeks ago when I tried to attend a few conferences of opposition parties in Serbia .
During that weekend , I was refused an entry visa whilst , two weeks prior to this , many international guests had been able to attend that bizarre conference staged by Milosevic .
It shows that every effort is being made to keep out outside influences .
There is also talk of curtailing communication by telephone , e-mail and keeping tabs on written correspondence .
The government seems keen to remove the opposition from local authorities , where they have been entitled to be since the previous local elections .
The new regime can only win the new local elections , expected in May , if the opposition is , in effect , eliminated .
I find this a dangerous game .
Consequently , we would like to see extensive protests against this media repression , but the EU should also look for ways to provide direct support to Serbia ' s independent media .
The latter is a vital lifeline for the opposition which will be mounting campaigns again this spring and which certainly deserves our support , also where the media is concerned .
Mr President , we have started a new round - the umpteenth - in Milosevic ' s war against the free media .
So much is clear . It seems to be heralding the elections in a perverse kind of way .
The campaign has started and anyone who disagrees with him needs to keep their mouths shut .
It is really unacceptable that elections will soon take place - allegedly formal , democratic elections - in a country where the opposition has first been left without any tool to express itself .
It is a trademark of a totalitarian regime which knows all too well that free , independent media are a nuisance and pose a threat , even to a regime such as that of Milosevic .
The EU ' s support - on which we are probably all agreed - can roughly take two forms .
It would be beneficial to support the media in the neighbouring countries : Croatia and a number of other countries have been mentioned .
I am in favour of this . But it can never replace support provided to the media in Yugoslavia , in Serbia , media which deserve this support .
The EU makes a difference .
The EU has made a difference in the past with its support . It has an obligation to do this in future and should also be given the means to do this .
This is fine within the framework of the new CARA programme , but it is also particularly important that this should happen in two weeks ' time , in conjunction with the Stability Pact .
At the finance conference on the Stability Pact , the European Union can and must commit itself to a number of programmes .
The programmes are ready , the necessity is there ; let us take swift and unambiguous action .
This crook , this old communist crook , is able to remain in power on account of his virtual monopoly of radio and TV and his oppression of any critical independent alternative , among other factors .
Various actions have been undertaken on the part of the European Union , such as providing independent stations with equipment .
But now that one station after the other is being closed down , the EU will need to act again in consultation with the affected parties .
We just heard that Mr Wiersma was denied a visa to visit the opposition in Belgrade .
Now that the Stability Pact will be coming into its own , the help of the neighbouring states will provide a new and sound alternative , especially now that Croatia has experienced a political U-turn .
Alternative reports can be directly provided via stations in Croatia and also in Montenegro .
The Stability Pact can only succeed if Serbia is a democratic constitutional state , not before , and once the criminals have been brought to justice .
As long as Milosevic and his friends can introduce laws which undermine the traditional human rights and human freedoms , as long as this is the case , the outlook for Serbia remains bleak .
It is unfortunate that the internal opposition is so weak and so divided nationally .
The European Union will need to look for powers in Serbia which are not driven by this blinkered nationalism but by values whose observance has also proved to benefit humanity in the European Union .
Mr President , we will gladly support our compromise resolution , especially once the GUE / NGL has pulled out .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is not the first time that we have debated the media in Serbia ; we have been discussing this matter for years .
It has become clear over the last two years that the media are being increasingly sidelined .
But we have already said that .
How weak must the Milosevic regime really feel , given how it treats the media ?
I think he is terrified of this and we should help the media so that they can spread the truth about Milosevic and his regime .
Mr President , apparently , the Milosevic regime is not tired of fighting battles , not by a long shot .
Recently , it has taken systematic action against local stations , in particular .
It does not flinch from using violence in these activities .
Neither do the government-run media shrink from launching a full-blown witch hunt against the country ' s independent media . They are then termed rather scornfully ' NATO agents ' and ' traitors of the mother country ' .
It is not by chance that the powerful Serbian police apparatus operates mainly at local level , especially in those towns and cities where the opposition emerged victorious in the 1996 local elections .
With the same elections round the corner and parliamentary elections not too far off either , many in Serbia suspect that the Milosevic regime has already launched its own campaign .
The target , regional radio and television stations , is an obvious one from a Milosevic viewpoint .
Anyone in Serbia ' s small and medium-sized towns who wants to see and hear anything other than what is spouted parrot-fashion by the state media based in Belgrade is heavily reliant on these stations .
By the way : the few independent papers that do exist are hard to come by in the provinces .
This once again underlines the significance of a political counter weight on the Serbian air waves .
As can be expected , Serbia ' s dictator is fighting his battle against the as yet independent media in an underhand manner .
Legalistic arguments over missing licences or outstanding financial state payments mask the true political intentions : to silence his own people as much as possible .
What did receive the official seal of approval for the Serbian population , however , were the politically correct pop music stations of Slobo ' s son Marko and daughter Marija .
Given this sad situation , all those in Serbia who stand up for the freedom of the press deserve our support .
This is not just verbal support , but also tangible support in the form of new transmission equipment being provided to the affected stations , following consultation , as stipulated in paragraph 3 of the present joint resolution .
Milosevic ' s willing servants are then welcome to hold on to the confiscated technical equipment .
Situation in Iraq :
The UN inspectors responsible for monitoring disarmament in Iraq have destroyed or ordered the destruction of the stocks of arms , material and products that could lead to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction .
They have made sure that Iraq has no long-range missiles that could threaten its neighbours .
That is why our resolution calls for this embargo to be lifted .
Nonetheless , the US Government refuses to definitively lift the embargo , on the pretext that Iraq has not respected its obligations .
Without offering the slightest proof , Washington continues to accuse Iraq of secretly manufacturing biological and chemical weapons .
Washington has refused this proposal too , thus creating a situation which primarily hits the Iraqi people and not their leaders .
According to the UN humanitarian agencies , several hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , including some 500 000 children , have died prematurely because of the embargo , for lack of food , medicines or adequate care .
According to that delegation , the ' oil for food ' programme is a totally inadequate response to the urgent physical needs of the Iraqis .
Mr Eric Rouleau , the former French Ambassador , speaks of a slow-motion genocide .
Our resolution therefore calls for an end to this situation .
However , we also think we need a broader debate on this subject . That is why we are not putting this resolution to the vote today .
On an issue as serious as this one , we prefer , first of all , to call for a Commission and Council declaration .
We are therefore proposing that this debate be deferred to the month of April .
Mr President , the situation before us arises from the Iraqi Government ' s refusal to accept United Nations Resolution 1284 .
The British and American Governments have already given it to be understood that , in this case , hostilities would be resumed .
I feel that we should focus our attention on the possibility of preventing this from happening .
It must be made clear that , at the end of the United Nations mission , the embargo will be lifted - not just suspended , but lifted once and for all .
No one will consider rebuilding Iraq if it is obvious that there will only be four months of stability , and that , after that , the embargo could be reimposed without fresh , credible reasons .
We have attempted to besiege Iraq and to force the Iraqi people to change their government through the embargo and we have not succeeded , even though we have been trying for seven and a half years .
Instead of driving the Iraqis to rebel against the regime in power , the embargo has induced them to hostility towards the West , and in any case , has made them incapable of any kind of action .
Iraqis are not going to die of starvation .
The people need more than medicine : they need us to go out there and rebuild their water supply network , their drainage system and their power stations , restoring an adequate quality of life .
I feel that our resolution should also serve to reassure the State of Israel .
We must therefore make it clear to Israel that a major concern of our policy is the defence of the State of Israel and the right of the State of Israel to exist .
Nevertheless , I realise that it is also important for us to achieve as great a consensus as possible in order to give our governments a firm basis .
But the debate will continue , regardless of what is going to happen in the next part-session in April and which I hope will accord with the political wishes the two of you have expressed here .
So the debate continues and the resolutions are withdrawn .
Mr President , I too am sorry that the vote will not now be taking place .
I am concerned , as are the other speakers , at the plight of the people in Iraq .
One should never forget that the plight of the people in Iraq is being inflicted upon them by their own government .
We want to make that message as loud and clear and unequivocal as we possibly can .
Mr President , the UN sanctions have become a weapon of mass destruction , claiming at least 200 children 's lives every day .
Mary Robinson , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , has been speaking out against the sanctions imposed in violation of international law , which prohibits the starving of civilians as a method of warfare .
She says : ' How can you expect me to condemn human rights abuses in Algeria , China and elsewhere when the United Nations themselves are responsible for the situation in Iraq ? '
The UN economic sanctions have denied Iraqis spare parts to restore infrastructure , making water and airborne infectious disease rampant .
Furthermore , the shortage of medical and food aid has made deaths from these treatable diseases epidemic .
The UN estimates that five to six thousand children die unnecessarily each month due to sanctions , even after the UN food for oil programme .
The sanctions constitute relentless lethal force , and innocent Iraqi people caught between opposing forces are paying the price .
It cannot continue .
This is ridiculous : a war is being waged against voiceless children basically because the United States , and indeed the British , are supporting this kind of inhumanity to their fellow man .
Whatever the details , whichever way you look at it , it is a damned dangerous situation which we have to avoid .
Without making a value judgement , I think that both countries , India and Pakistan , must exercise extreme restraint .
The one with regard to increasingly frequent violations of its borders and the other with regard to increasingly frequent proven discrimination against sections of the population , especially Muslim sections of the population in India .
We have to support all available initiatives .
We are not the ones in the hot seat when it comes to taking initiatives .
The United Nations and , without doubt , the United States of America find themselves in this position .
But it is incumbent upon us to state clearly that this conflict needs to be resolved , not exacerbated .
What we must not do is keep quiet .
Mr President , I am pleased that we are debating this resolution today even though I would have preferred the ELDR resolution to have been the one we are debating .
India and Pakistan have carried on this conflict for over fifty years now .
There were UN resolutions that called for a plebiscite for the people of Kashmir all that time ago , and still nothing has happened .
It is even more important now that we find a solution , especially as both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers .
That is why I hope India and Pakistan will come to the negotiating table , together with the people of Kashmir .
I would like to see either the European Union or the USA acting as an honest broker , as a mediator , to try to find an end to this dispute .
But whatever happens , the human rights abuses must stop .
We have daily reports of rapes , murder , torture , and a lot of people say , " Oh , this is an exaggeration " .
But when I was in Azad Kashmir and I went to one of the refugee camps a few years ago I was very moved by the first-hand accounts I heard .
I was even more moved when I went into a tent where the women and children were .
I went up to one woman and although we could not speak each other ' s languages we stood there and hugged each other .
That woman was sobbing her heart out .
I could almost touch the pain , really feel the pain of that woman .
She was not acting it , she was not pretending it - nobody goes to a refugee camp for fun .
They were there because they had been tortured , they had been mistreated and they were escaping .
That was not an isolated incident , and it is still happening today .
We must find a solution .
They must come to the negotiating table .
Mr President , I am as delighted as others are that we are having this debate today for the first time in our elected parliament in this session .
It is long overdue , for the reasons which our previous speakers have already underlined .
Relations between India and Pakistan are indeed deteriorating , with Kashmir being a particular bone of contention .
Tensions are also being aggravated by the fact that these two countries are nuclear powers .
Indeed , in the Herald Tribune of Tuesday , March 14 , 2000 , the headline reads : " Nuclear war between India and Pakistan is a real possibility " .
It is increasingly an international problem and one where mediation will , in my view , become essential .
So what can we do to bring long-term stability to this volatile region ?
We discussed this issue when we met with members of the US Congress in our normal framework of delegations earlier this year .
As these two approaches are made , this two-pronged approach by the European Union and the United States is , in my view , the best way to start the process for long-term peace and stability in this region .
I am then often ashamed at how little influence we can exert as a huge economic power in the political field .
This is why I welcome the debate on this conflict today .
However , we should not just treat it as a conflict between Pakistan and India regarding the respective spheres of influence that the two countries want to see established .
Very often , the people who actually live there are not taken into account .
Although the UN resolutions of 1948 and 1949 stipulated that the fate of Kashmir and Jammu should be decided by a referendum under international supervision , this never actually happened .
This appears to have awakened world opinion again .
I am convinced that international mediation is desirable and necessary .
I am therefore happy to concur with what Kofi Annan said concerning this matter , but I do hope that this will not prejudice the right to self-determination on the part of the peoples involved .
Mr President .
Over a year ago , in February 1999 , there was hope for new relations between India and Pakistan .
In the Lahore declaration , both presidents confirmed their determination to comply with the 1972 Simla agreement .
Unfortunately , the Lahore process came to a standstill during the clash over Kargil between May and July 1999 .
The latest development in Kashmir is worrying .
We condemn the continuing human rights violations , the religious fanaticism , the sabotage and the terrorism .
The cause lies in activities by rebels who are operating across the border , across the line of control from the Pakistani side and systematically attacking unarmed civilians .
India has repeatedly accused the government and Islamabad of backing the guerrillas with technical and military know-how .
Border crossings have to be prevented along a 700 km stretch of country which is hard to monitor .
The political and military situation needs to be further stabilised in order to create a climate for bilateral talks .
The Indian government has already declared that it is prepared to resume negotiations , provided that the demarcation line is strictly adhered to and fundamentalist tendencies are checked .
We must work on achieving a rapprochement between the two neighbouring states , the Islamic state of Pakistan and the multinational state of India .
It is up to Commissioner Patten and the high representative of the Council , Mr Solana , to ensure that the European Union has a chance to distinguish itself as a successful international mediator in conflict situations .
First , on the presidential elections in Peru , the Peruvian authorities invited both the EU presidency and the Commission to send observers to the elections .
A consultation took place between the Commission and the Member States , concluding that the situation does not justify the organisation and deployment of a full EU observation mission .
Some Member States announced , however , that they would be sending observers on a bilateral basis including , in some cases , representatives of their national parliaments .
They are also supporting the mission of observers of the Organisation of American States , led by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala , Mr Eduardo Stein .
On the human rights situation in Chechnya I have the following comments .
The Commission is also deeply concerned about increasing evidence of human rights abuses in Chechnya .
It was exactly these issues I discussed very directly with the Russian Government during my visit to the region at the beginning of February .
We are still waiting for an answer from the Russian authorities on these concrete proposals .
On the media situation in Serbia , the mounting series of actions taken against Studio B by the authorities last week are wholly unacceptable and we deplore them .
The increasing pressure put on the independent media shows just how important those media are .
The European Commission has made great efforts to support the independent media in Serbia .
In December 1999 we approved a EUR 3.3 million programme of support .
Satellite equipment is being distributed across the region to Croatia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia .
This will only prolong the crisis in Iraq .
Oil for food remains the best short-term option to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi population .
In the longer term , the economic and social situation in Iraq can only be improved by increased economic activities stimulated by lifting sanctions .
Ways should be pursued to engage the Iraqi government in a dialogue on the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions which might lead to a gradual easing of sanctions .
But let us be clear - the key to the lifting of sanctions lies with the Iraqis .
The Commission has , since the Gulf War in 1991 , been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq , to the tune of over EUR 242 million .
Another EUR 8.6 million is allocated from the 2000 ECHO budget .
The Commission is , however , concerned about the restrictions imposed by the Iraqi Government on NGO operations , which may jeopardise the implementation of ECHO financed humanitarian aid programmes in Iraq .
Finally , Mr President , on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir , the Commission welcomes the European Parliament 's deep concern regarding the Kashmir conflict reflected in the different draft resolutions .
The international community 's concern for the region is a legitimate one , particularly as both sides possess nuclear weapons and as dialogue between them has , at this stage , effectively broken down .
Precisely because of this impasse and the high risks involved , third parties must adopt a balanced approach .
Third parties may urge both sides to de-escalate military confrontation in a structured way and resume comprehensive dialogue with a view to relaunching the Lahore peace process .
Pakistan should be asked to put a stop to infiltration of paramilitary personnel crossing over from their side of the line of control .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m. , except on the situation in Iraq , as agreed .
Combatting organised crime
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0259 / 2000 by Mr Procacci , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the fight against organised crime in South-East Europe ;
B5-0267 / 2000 by Mr Lavarra and others , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the fight against organised crime ;
B5-0274 / 2000 by Mrs Frassoni and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on the urgent situation created by crime linked to illegal trafficking in Apulia ( Italy ) ;
B5-0277 / 2000 by Mr Le Pen and others , on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members , on organised crime ;
B5-0284 / 2000 by Mr Fitto and others , on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on organised crime .
Italians are familiar with the difficulties of dealing with organised crime .
The means and resources donated by the European Community would not be used for healthy growth , but would serve to further strengthen the canker of underground organisations .
I think that we in this European Parliament owe it to the relatives of the victims to acknowledge that respect for the dead is not an Italian but a European matter .
That is the first point which I wished to make here .
The second is a political challenge which , in my view , we are not taking seriously enough .
However , the police counter-strategies needed still mainly come within the jurisdiction of the nation states .
The instruments to fight organised crime are organised at intergovernmental level .
Where I live , in the district of Aachen , there is a town called Herzogenrath .
This is a practical example of the difficulties inherent in the fight against organised crime and clearly illustrates the need for a cross-border , or rather a pan-European approach .
Mr President , for a long time , cigarette smuggling has had a rather romantic appeal in Italy , which it acquired particularly after the war thanks to the influence of neorealist films .
However , the events taking place in Puglia and the South of Italy are not at all romantic . Quite the opposite .
The European Union is making a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia .
The actions of the local authorities and our initiatives to assist them are absolutely vital elements in the fight against organised crime , and are therefore also crucial for the safety of Europeans .
We regret that the joint resolution did not take up our suggestion to make the new reconstruction programmes conditional upon an undertaking by the governments of the former Yugoslavia to cooperate actively in the fight against organised crime .
Europe is attempting to enlarge its borders and create an area of freedom , security and justice .
The Adriatic is a border and so is the Ionian Sea .
We have already paid too high a price in deaths - too many civilians gave their lives in the raids in Puglia - and we have lost too many men from the forces of law and order .
In consideration also of the existence of the Stability Pact , we need to take practical steps to show that the enlargement of Europe will also mean greater security for our people .
Mr President , when it comes to this issue , I am in two minds .
We need a pan-European system of internal security , and here the Balkans are naturally a special cause for concern because we have assumed responsibility in Kosovo and the neighbouring regions .
On the other hand , however , we must take care not to classify certain peoples in a particular manner .
We are therefore against point 4 of the joint resolution which names Montenegro .
Of course , Montenegro also has internal security problems , as we do in the EU for that matter .
But Montenegro presently faces a huge threat ; as you will have heard , and as officially confirmed by NATO yesterday , Milosevic has again started military operations against Montenegro .
We must be careful not to give him an excuse .
Therefore , solidarity in the fight against organised crime , yes , but please , no specific passage on Montenegro ; just support for Montenegro in its struggle for greater freedom .
The links between criminal groups in different countries and the increasingly wide geographical spread of crime call for a supranational response .
After all , security is one of Europe ' s objectives in the Treaty of Amsterdam and was on the agenda of the European Council held in Tampere in the autumn of 1999 .
We hope that substantial decisions similar to those proposed in Tampere will be taken regarding the creation of common investigation groups , a European police academy and a genuine European judiciary such as EUROJUS .
This is the path we must take , taking due account of the fight against crime taking place in the Balkan States in our relations with these countries .
The Commission has examined with great interest the resolution concerning the threat posed by the development of illicit activities of criminal groups operating in several countries of south-eastern Europe .
Clearly a lot of these criminal activities have serious negative consequences for the Community and its Member States .
Although many actions envisaged aim to encourage cooperation between the fifteen Member States , the plan does not neglect the need also to develop wider forms of international cooperation .
The tangible result has been the conclusion by the Council in 1998 of the Pre-accession Pact on cooperation against crime with the candidate countries .
The Commission considers that it can prove and provide a useful input to the Stability Pact by combining the Member States ' expertise and the Community funds in order to set up well-targeted anti-crime projects and activities .
In this respect , the Commission is also ready to act as a coordinator and in close consultation with the special coordinator of the Stability Pact .
Furthermore , I have to underline that the Commission is preparing a proposal for a new specific financial instrument which will provide a global legal basis for the Community assistance to the whole region .
An official proposal will be presented to the Council by the end of this month and we hope that a new regulation will come into force as soon as possible , hopefully just after the summer break .
These groups work to combat organised crime whose transnational dimension has been demonstrated on several occasions .
They have been established to provide support and operational assistance that focuses its investigations on the sectors and products which are most vulnerable to fraud , which is the case for cigarettes .
The results of the activities of these task groups recorded over the last few years are particularly significant .
In 1996 , for instance , cigarette smuggling , mainly in the transit regime , totalled ECU 800 m .
The overall financial impact of fraud detected in this area in 1997 was an estimated ECU 1.6 bn covering Community own resources and national revenue .
The number of inquiries against cigarette smuggling even increased in 1998 , although the financial impact was lower than in the previous years .
This can be explained by the continuation of large international inquiries and the success in the fight against cigarette smuggling from Andorra and against the black market in Spain .
All in all we take these threats to the Community very seriously and will continue working hard to fight them .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
CITES
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
B5-0249 / 2000 by Mr Sjöstedt and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) ;
B5-0269 / 2000 by Mrs Roth-Behrendt , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) ;
Mr President , first of all , I would like to apologise on behalf of Mrs Maij-Weggen , who submitted this resolution .
She has had to leave earlier on account of a death and funeral in the family .
It is not the first time in this House that the CITES Convention is being mentioned .
Over the years , this Convention , with its 148 signatories , has saved many plants and animals threatened with extinction .
Once again , it seems unlikely that the correct decisions will be taken at the CITES meeting in Nairobi and once again , we will be stepping in to prevent the wrong decisions from being taken .
In this intervention , I would like to focus on three risks .
We urge the Commission and Member States not to go along with this .
The list of illegally traced ivory is already so extensive that a legal hunt would only exacerbate the problem .
A second risk which I would like to point out is Norway ' s and Japan ' s proposal to re-legalise the hunt for the minke whale in the North Atlantic and the Southern Pacific .
Again we are opposed to this , if only because these lovely animals are already being hunted down by both countries .
Re-legalisation would only further reward bad behaviour .
In addition , this minke whale is an endangered species and it would be preferable to keep to the arrangement to protect all whales .
Finally , I would like to give a third example .
Cuba has requested to move the hawksbill turtle back to appendix II . This is the result of a typically isolated view of an animal generally threatened with extinction .
This would be a tremendous incentive to continuing the illegal hunt .
In a nutshell , these are three examples from a series of proposals in Nairobi which cause us great concern .
We urge the Commission and Member States not to support this type of proposal but to keep CITES as it is .
Let us not start this century on a bad note but on a good note and work together to ensure that no more plants and animals are threatened with extinction .
Mr President , as the previous speaker said , this resolution is addressed to the parties to the CITES Convention meeting in Nairobi in April .
I want to refer briefly to three essential measures which ought to be taken in Nairobi in the days ahead .
The first is providing information and raising awareness amongst the public , the buyers and sellers .
The second is sanction mechanisms against those who have not yet adopted legal measures to stop poachers , in particular , benefiting from impunity .
And the third is cooperation with developing countries , because sometimes trafficking and trading in threatened species is the only way to survive in their rural areas .
Mr President , protecting animal and plant species which are threatened with extinction is about more than just preserving the natural riches .
It is about a battle between civilisation and barbarism .
Maintaining bio-diversity is also about more than preventing the extinction of certain animal species , however important these may be , such as elephants and whales .
Since the individual species are unable to stand up for themselves , we need to do this for them , at home or elsewhere .
This means , for example , that the international transport of tropical animals must be regulated .
Even today , there are scandalous cases of abuse , both in legal and illegal transportation .
Over-exploitation and misuse cannot be explained by poverty alone .
They often involve ruthless traders who only have their own self-interests at heart .
Although we may not be aware of it , huge numbers of animals are also the victims of natural disasters and especially wars in Africa .
Animals are , by definition , not just there for our amusement .
It is only right that a civilised society should give their beastly fate more attention .
Mr President , at the previous CITES conference , the European Parliament almost unanimously adopted a resolution to accord the African elephant the highest status of protection .
The African elephant is still a threatened animal species , according to the IUCN .
Fourteen EU Ministers faint-heartedly abstained from the vote and , as a result , legalised the shooting of elephants in Africa .
The Dutch Minister was the only one to vote for the conservation of the elephant .
Between 10 and 20 April next , the fate of this elephant will once again feature on the agenda of the world community .
Kenya , the hosting nation , and India have tabled the proposal to grant the African elephant full protection once again .
Shooting elephants in order to sell their tusks to Japan and then giving the proceeds away - at least on paper - to protect wild animals is a perverse kind of logic .
Besides which , it does not work .
South Africa , Botswana , Namibia and Zambia want to shoot even more elephants now .
This blood money also ends up in the wrong hands .
I would call on the 15 Environment Ministers , including the 6 Green Ministers , to show courage and to grant the African elephant full protection once again on 30 March during the Environmental Council .
Full protection is also needed for the hawksbill turtle which is only to be found in Cuba .
In the space of three generations , more than 80 % of the population has disappeared .
Regarding the African elephant and the hawksbill turtle , the European Commission gives priority to the blood trade with Japan .
This is scandalous .
Mr President , the European Community is not a party to CITES .
The present text of the Convention permits only individual countries to join .
The Gaborone amendment to the CITES text from 1983 would allow us to become a party to the Convention .
However , this amendment has not yet entered into force due to the insufficient number of CITES parties who have ratified it .
The Commission continues its diplomatic efforts to ensure that a sufficient number of ratifications are made in order to allow the Community to play a more proactive role in this important Convention .
Notwithstanding the fact that we are not yet a party , the Community possesses legislation to implement CITES .
This legislation is amongst the most thorough and comprehensive of its kind in the world .
The Commission 's policy is based on both conservation and sustainable use , principles recognising that peoples and states are the best protectors of their own wild fauna and flora .
Concerning the specific matters in Parliament 's resolutions , we agree on the need to step up enforcement measures in the field of wildlife trade in India .
We will approach the Indian authorities along the lines suggested , and continue to do all we can to support and further the objectives of CITES .
Concerning the proposals for the forthcoming Conference of the CITES parties , the Commission has yet to adopt a formal proposal .
However , our general orientation on the major issues is as follows :
On whales , the Community 's position should be unambiguous .
No return to commercial whaling until the International Whaling Commission deems that the appropriate management controls are in place .
We should therefore oppose the Japanese and Norwegian proposals to restart the trade .
On African elephants , we favour the maintenance of the status quo until a clear picture emerges of the impact of the international trade that was permitted in 1997 .
We should not support any of the proposals that have been made .
Concerning the Cuban sea-turtle proposals , the Community should oppose the resumption of the regular annual trade in shells .
We need , however , to hold a more open position on the disposal of the Cuban shell stockpiles until we know the position of the neighbouring countries to Cuba .
Finally , on sharks , there is cause for concern , and the proposal on basking sharks should , in particular , be supported .
Here , however , CITES will need to work closely with regional fisheries bodies and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
Mr President , I see from my order paper that the vote on the situation in Iraq has been withdrawn .
Can I be told at whose request , and what reasons were given for withdrawing that ?
It was not the vote which was withdrawn ; on the contrary , the movers of the motions themselves withdrew both their motions .
If there is no motion to vote on , then obviously no vote can then be held .
Perhaps Mr Swoboda can briefly explain what is behind this .
Mr President , you are quite right , we have withdrawn the motions for resolutions .
If I may briefly explain , we withdrew them because we shall be holding a longer , more detailed debate on this subject during the next Strasbourg session .
I think that it makes more sense , given the worsening situation in Iraq , to hold a debate once the Council and Commission have made statements detailing their position rather than under the urgency procedure .
That was our reason for withdrawing them .
Mr President , may I confirm that what Mr Swoboda just said applies equally to the EPP-ED Group .
We have withdrawn our motion for a resolution for the same reasons , i.e. the debate scheduled for April .
Thank you , Mrs Grossetête , I think the reasons are now clear .
Mr Buttiglione wishes to raise a point of order .
Thank you , Mr Buttiglione .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Vote ( continuation )
Mr President , although it would have been better if we had voted at lunchtime , I am happy to go ahead now .
Mr President , I support the proposal by my friend , the very honourable member , Baroness Ludford , with pleasure .
Let us proceed with the vote .
Mr President , I should just like to ask why the sudden change of mind by the members .
Mr Posselt , I suggest that you ask them yourselves later .
I do not want a public debate in plenary on the matter .
Before the vote on Amendment 53
Mr President , on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group , I wish to withdraw Amendments 53 and 55 relating to paragraph 17 of the report .
It does indeed seem that the wording of these two amendments could give rise to conflicting interpretations , especially in certain language versions .
I am against ethnic classifications , because that would stigmatise immigrants .
Amendments 53 and 55 called for the term " ethnic " to be deleted .
Those are the reasons why I decided to withdraw these two amendments .
Thank you .
We have noted your remarks .
The mover of the motion had the foresight to withdraw the motion before the vote .
We are not therefore voting on it .
( Parliament approved the motion for a resolution )
I would ask for this to be considered .
If you have now changed your mind , you must submit a motion to amend the agenda again and then I shall gladly proceed otherwise .
Mr President , I freely admit that I have room for improvement .
Mr Swoboda , that applies to both of us !
Mr President , on a point of order , I am very pleased that this report has gone through .
We spent a very long time voting on this .
Most of these amendments were put down either by members of the technical group of racists or by the EPP on positions that they lost in committee .
We should not be spending so long voting on amendments put down when they lost their position earlier on .
We could have done it much more quickly because the position has been quite clear .
You have touched on a fundamental problem which has to do with the way in which this has been entered on the agenda .
If , according to the agenda , these proposed amendments have been submitted in time , then the President will call them and deal with them as usual .
Mr Speroni wishes to raise a point of order .
Mr President , I do not know whether there has been an interpreting error , but Mr Evans called us the " technical group of racists " , whereas we are the Technical Group of Independent Members .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is the first explanation of vote which I have given in many years and my first explanation of vote as chairman of the EPP-ED Group .
Unfortunately , our Group was unable , for a number of fundamental reasons , to vote in favour of the Ludford report on countering racism and xenophobia in the European Union .
Most of our group therefore abstained or voted against .
Our reasons were as follows .
Thirdly : the Ludford report addresses matters which lie outside the time framework of the report and have nothing whatsoever to do with the report .
I consider that unacceptable .
My Group has therefore been compelled either to abstain or to vote against the report .
( Applause )
Mr President , I voted against this report because I judge a good bottle of wine by its contents , not its label .
This report may well have an anti-racism label , but it contains an indigestible brew of ideologically confused nonsense and does not merit the title of an anti-racism report .
Although we do not agree with many of the recitals in the report on countering racism and xenophobia , we voted for that report because it takes a stance against discrimination and in favour of the rights of minorities .
Yet we certainly do not go along with the way Parliament is congratulating itself .
First of all , because most of the proposals to promote the rights of minorities and immigrants remain vague and are not binding .
But , on the other hand , by contrast with the Haarder report which we voted for this morning , this report is long on radical demagoguery and short on legal rigour .
Now this Parliament , as co-legislator , should know that any statement it makes has either legal value or , as in this case , quasi-legal value , and that is why greater care must be taken .
That obviously violates the Treaty right away .
It is badly drafted .
And I could give further examples of this kind of thing to justify our abstention .
Mr President , I should like to give a very brief explanation on behalf of the Austrian delegation of Socialists .
We abstained on point 10 .
We would have preferred a statement in keeping with the European Parliament ' s resolution on Austria .
But as this point was accepted nonetheless , we voted in favour of the report on account of its fundamentally positive thrust .
I do not think this kind of resolution does any credit to our Parliament .
- My Group and I are pleased to have voted for and supported the Ludford report which is concerning the important subject of the fight against racism and xenophobia .
The fight against the racists and xenophobes in our society , those who seek to divide Europe , is one that must and will be won .
.
( SV ) We conservatives support most of the measures against racism and xenophobia in the Ludford report .
We are , nonetheless , abstaining from voting in the final vote because we believe that labour market legislation is an area to which the subsidiarity principle ought to be applied , as mentioned in paragraph 17 .
I think the approach taken in these reports is a kind of violation of our terms of reference .
The differences are being ironed out at every level , for the Haarder report also supports equal rights for same-sex couples and the traditional family .
The two reports also join forces in calling for the right of immigrants to vote and stand for election in local and European elections .
I think that second category is highly significant .
And , of course , they insist that , in future , this document must be legally binding on the Member States .
Here as ever we see that the European level is the point of least resistance in face of pressure groups , of extraneous minorities , even of foreign interests .
- ( DA ) We are in favour of the humanitarian angle from which the report has been drawn up .
We are in favour of the report focusing upon the breeding grounds for racism and xenophobia in Europe .
We think it is important to combat racism and xenophobia by guaranteeing citizens the rights to education , access to the labour market etc .
It is also positive that the report should recommend that citizens of third countries should have better opportunities for integration .
For the aforesaid reasons , we have chosen to vote in favour of the report , since we basically think it is extremely important to combat racism and xenophobia .
We would emphasise , however , that we cannot support the means of combating racism and xenophobia that the report recommends .
We believe that measures such as drawing up a common asylum policy and establishing EURODAC - which would cause asylum seekers to be viewed with suspicion - would not further the fight against racism and xenophobia .
- ( FR ) I congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of her work on the European Commission ' s report on the implementation of the European Year Against Racism ( 1997 ) .
Recent events in Austria demonstrate that it is , alas , still necessary today to combat racism , antisemitism and xenophobia .
As the report points out , we really must express " horror at the entry into Government in Austria of Jörg Haider ' s Freedom Party " .
Let me take this opportunity to repeat that we must keep up the pressure on the Austrian Government and continue to encourage public debate .
For there is indeed a strong risk that people will simply become used to the situation .
I repeat : the great risk is that it will become part of everyday life .
This open breach of the founding principle of our European Union , namely unconditional respect for fundamental rights , must not create a precedent .
Throughout Europe , extreme right-wing parties are hoping to exploit the entry into power of this coalition with its fascist connotations .
So it is our duty as European democrats to remain vigilant , to tempt this government into a foolish mistake that will lead to its fall .
I personally am prepared to take this fight to the bitter end .
Like the rapporteur , I believe that the ethnic , religious , cultural and linguistic diversity of Europe is a source of vitality and that it is essential for Europe ' s future economic prosperity and social success .
That is why the public authorities of the Member States and the EU institutions must actively promote racial equality and take concrete action to achieve greater ethnic diversity among their staff .
I also agree that leading the fight against racism and xenophobia and the promotion of equal opportunities should be an explicit responsibility allocated to one European Commissioner .
One other proposal deserves our full attention .
Coming back to Austria , one reason why it has come to this extreme situation is perhaps that this country does not have a sufficiently objective memory of the past .
in writing .
It is especially worth highlighting the need to give the citizens of third countries resident in the European Union political rights , by granting them the right to vote in local and European elections .
For those reasons , our vote is in favour of the report .
- As a former Minister in the UK for race relations I am very much aware of the need to look constantly for ways of improving relations between all groups and interests in the population .
This requires a careful mixture , firstly of education , and only when absolutely necessary , of legislation .
This report totally fails to provide a balanced approach .
It is gesture politics at their worst with the clear ideology of the author taking precedence over good sense .
It is damaging through its stridency .
It gives no credit for the great achievements in race relations in EU states .
It offers only a defeatist agenda , not one of a positive nature .
It insults those who are trying to improve a situation and therefore it is offensive to many .
In short , it is an abuse of the opportunities offered by our Parliament to debate and determine issues like this which are vital and important and deserve better than this approach .
Those of us who really care know the great difficulties of this subject .
This report would undermine rather than improve race relations .
That cannot be a desirable outcome .
This pathological , fanatical and obsessive ' anti-racist ' mania is being used merely as a psychological lever in the process of colonising Europe and forcing its people into submission .
The moral inquisition , propaganda and constant psychological conditioning to which we are being subjected are worthy of the most despicable methods applied in the communist regimes ' ' re-education ' camps .
But this report will at least have the merit , thanks to the Baroness and her cronies , of letting us find out who the new collaborators are .
Stand up and be counted !
- ( FR ) Europe is facing real difficulties today .
Like it or not , it is not the path of glory it aspired to be for the citizens of the Member States .
It reflects what it is , namely a remote and restrictive machine whose sole purpose seems to be to enact finicky legislative rules obviously aimed at centralisation and standardisation .
That could have allowed us to inject a little ' soul ' into a system sadly in need of it .
But that was not to be .
The rapporteur , the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs and the plenary have served us up documents that smell of death .
These pseudo-defenders of the rights of man have quite simply forgotten that man is not a concept , a point in a political programme .
The human being has a dignity , a mission that are far superior , if not contrary , to what is being put before us today .
Respect for the human being means recognising that his legitimate rights correspond to legitimate obligations , that he must exercise his freedom responsibly , that his natural dignity presupposes moral points of reference .
I would not so much say that the European Parliament has missed an opportunity as that it has once again been true to itself , libertarian and , in the final analysis , liberticidal .
- ( FR ) Today , the European Parliament is presenting us with the new man in a new world .
Oh how wonderful it must be to live in China , in Cuba or in North Korea !
This is not serious .
Communities , whether national or European , need points of reference that are not exclusive but that guarantee enduring relations .
Our nations are often pluri-secular , they have always attracted populations and ethnic groups different from their own , who have added their value to that of their hosts .
This happened without problem , because our nations presented these newcomers with identified systems within which they could easily find their bearings and their place .
Today , the Ludford report puts us at a remove from that Europe .
Report ( A5-0055 / 2000 ) by Mr Belder
Mr President , the only reason we voted for this report is to reaffirm that we are opposed on principle to any form of racism , xenophobia and oppression of minorities , within or outside the European Union .
However , that vote does not mean we agree with all the recitals and all the proposals in it .
- ( FR ) The European Commission presented this communication on countering racism in the candidate countries in response to the request by the Vienna European Council of 11 and 12 December 1998 .
The profound process of transformation that has been under way in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989 has had its impact on the rise of racism , xenophobia and antisemitism .
The high unemployment rate ( formerly an unknown social phenomenon , but now officially recognised ) , which resulted from the economic reforms , is making people feel more insecure .
All this creates fertile ground for the rise in forms of racism .
There is a risk that the changes resulting from the implementation of the Community acquis will further accentuate the social tensions in the candidate countries .
So it is vital to take vigorous action without delay to help these countries to tackle these problems .
The European Observatory of racism and xenophobia which will open its doors in Vienna on 10 April this year must also make a relevant contribution to continuing the fight against racism , xenophobia and antisemitism in the candidate countries .
The report highlights one very acute problem in the candidate countries , the problem of respect for the rights of minorities .
I am thinking particularly of the Roma , who face intolerable discrimination in several Central and Eastern European countries .
I am also thinking , obviously , of the problem of the institutionalised discrimination against the Kurdish people .
Let me take this opportunity to remind you that Mrs Leyla Zana , a Turkish parliamentarian of Kurdish origin , is still being held in Turkish jails after a parody of a trial .
So far , all the pressure exerted by the European Parliament has had no effect on the Turkish authorities ' position .
Sadly , Mrs Zana ' s case is no exception !
Turkey needs to make considerable progress in relation to respect for the Kurdish population .
That is the condition for its accession to the European Union and there can be no compromise on that !
ECB foreign reserve assets
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union has equipped itself with a politically independent Central Bank , responsible for safeguarding price stability .
The ECB must , at the very least , be financially independent .
Pursuant to the Treaty , the Bank ' s initial capital is fixed at EUR 5 billion while foreign exchange reserves are fixed at EUR 50 billion .
As the European System of Central Banks is currently composed of only 11 national central banks , the capital released is only EUR 3.9 billion , while currently transferred reserves come to only EUR 39.46 billion .
Of that , 15 % are in gold , while the remaining 85 % consist of US dollars and yen .
It should be noted that interest on its own capital is the European Central Bank ' s only reliable source of income .
In the short term , this income varies with interest rates .
The ECB ' s other source of income is the interest on its official reserves .
However , from that income the ECB has to deduct the interest it pays on its liabilities in euros vis-à-vis the national central banks .
The foreign exchange reserves that appear on the ECB ' s balance sheet are given in national currencies , while the liabilities vis-à-vis the national central banks are given in euros .
At present , given the interest rate differentials between the euro on the one hand , and the US dollar and the yen on the other , the net income from interest is positive .
Since the ECB holds currencies to offset liabilities in euros , it would also run a foreign exchange risk if the euro appreciated substantially against the reserve currencies it is holding .
An internal ECB calculation indicates that the foreign exchange value at risk could exceed the ECB ' s current capital .
A 10 % depreciation of the US dollar and the yen against the euro , accompanied by a 10 % fall in the price of gold , would wipe out all the ECB ' s existing capital .
The Treaty provides for a mechanism whereby the ECB can forearm itself against any erosion of its capital .
The European Central Bank can partially or totally retain the monetary income from the Eurosystem .
Nevertheless , a central bank that depended on being bailed out repeatedly would not be very credible .
In fact , the European Central Bank will probably close its 1999 financial year with a deficit of more than EUR 200 million .
So it is imperative to resolve this structural problem as quickly as possible .
On 14 April 1999 , the European Parliament endorsed an ECB recommendation on doubling its capital in the long term .
The recommendation under consideration today seeks to authorise the Governing Council to effect further calls of foreign reserves , raising the ceiling to EUR 100 billion .
So it is simply a question of authorisation in principle to increase reserves as needed , without being pressurised by exceptional events .
In this context it must be noted that the total reserves of the Eurosystem come to more than EUR 350 billion .
As President Duisenberg maintained at his last hearing before the European Parliament , the ECB does not intend to intervene on the foreign exchange markets to try to influence the external value of the euro .
In the event of another international financial crisis , which remains possible given the irrational exuberance of the markets , there could be a need for concerted intervention by the main central banks .
I have not proposed what might be called a political resolution to my colleagues .
Personally , as I said a while ago , I feel that Parliament votes on too many resolutions and that this inflated number of resolutions reduces the value of other , politically essential resolutions .
In this case it is a question of saying yes or no .
A massive yes vote also sends out a political message .
We want the ECB to be able to pursue its main objective of safeguarding price stability in total independence - including material independence .
We want the Central Bank to play its full part on the international scene and to make an active contribution to defining new rules that will enable the international financial system to operate without crises .
We are confident that the Governing Council will make optimum use of the foreign exchange reserves in the Eurosystem in the event of tension on the markets .
It would be warranted , however , for such internal ECB transfers , which will not be included in detail in the Eurosystem ' s weekly consolidated financial statements , to be disclosed a posteriori .
The European Parliament also assumes that the ECB President will explain the decisions taken by his Council when he appears before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and , indeed , during plenary debates .
The Central Bank has everything to gain from this improved transparency with regard to consolidating its credibility .
So its role is not just to satisfy the expectations of the financial markets .
What is the legal basis for today ' s debate ?
According to Article 3 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks , owning and managing official foreign reserve assets is one of the tasks of the ECB .
This call must be issued in the form of a regulation by the EU Council .
The ECB is currently calling for a further increase of 50 billion euros .
We , the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the entire Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , as the rapporteur has already said , welcome this proposal .
The reasons are set out in detail and time is already marching on , but allow me to say that we consider that this increase is needed .
First , because it will help to increase the financial independence of the ECB , and the independence of the European Central Bank is instrumental to the stability and unassailability of the currency .
The return on the capital paid up so far and the official reserves currently represents the ECB ' s only source of income for financing its operations .
We know that it sustained a loss in 1999 .
We must therefore admit that a lack of funds robs the ECB of the ability to formulate an independent and transparent policy .
Its financing requirements must be covered so that its independence cannot be called into question .
Secondly , we are in favour of this increase because it will help to foster the credibility of the ECB on the markets .
Thirdly : this increase will enhance the ability of the ECB to react and adapt .
In the event of a serious imbalance on the markets , possibly doubling its reserves gives the European Central Bank the potential to carry out its task in the form of a stability policy more effectively .
It gives it the possibility to react more flexibly because it has the necessary funds at its disposal .
Our report also introduces an additional model for strengthening the transparency of this procedure and I would therefore ask that you vote in favour of increasing the reserves .
Mr President , in this draft legislative resolution , Parliament approves the ECB ' s recommendation for a Council regulation concerning the continued calling in of foreign reserve assets .
The following reasons are given : first , the Treaty makes provision for this .
If it is not applied in the form of a regulation , this could be construed as a difference of opinion between the ECB and the Council .
Secondly , the ECB should gain in financial independence .
Thirdly , the foreign exchange intervention instrument will be made more credible and the capacity of the ECB to adjust to various scenarios will be fostered .
Of course , there can be no objection to any structural improvement of the ECB ' s financial situation .
The only question is whether or not pouring more money into it will solve the problem once and for all .
Before an answer can be given , the following questions at least must be considered :
Firstly : does it make political and economic sense to apply the sort of restrictive monetary policy which the ECB applies and which is more restrictive than the FED ?
Secondly , does the increase in interest rates for top refinancing facilities and deposit facilities applied on 9.2.2000 not run counter to economic growth ?
Thirdly , are more decisive measures to reduce unemployment permanently not the most tried and tested means of guaranteeing price stability ?
Fourthly : in addition to a supply-orientated economic policy , should greater emphasis not be placed on a demand-orientated economic policy , i.e. strengthening the European internal market through reduced import tax rates in the Member States ?
Fifthly , is it so wrong to assume that the exchange rate set when the euro was introduced had more to do with political wishful thinking than economic reality ?
Sixthly : what specific grounds are there for assuming that the ECB will probably sustain a loss in 1999 ?
Having answered these questions , our Group felt unable to vote for the proposal for a resolution .
Not because the ECB has too few foreign reserve assets , but because it is wrongly organised structurally and will therefore complain endlessly of these liquidity problems .
Mr President , the European Central Bank is recommending to the Council that it double its foreign reserve assets .
To that end , it puts forward two very different kinds of argument .
In a flash of lucidity , the ECB has declared that a central bank with a structural deficit would quite simply not be credible .
That is true , and it gives some cause for anxiety about the administrative ability of those who so quickly need to raise the ceiling level .
So it did not take long before the supposed instrument of EU independence and economic power so cruelly demonstrated its inadequacies .
No , really , we care little whether the ECB does or does not double its nuisance value .
Mr Goebbels points out that rejection by Parliament could be construed as indicating profound disagreement with the soundness of the policy pursued by the European Central Bank .
That is reason enough for us to vote against this text .
Mr President , we have good reason to be puzzled by the European Central Bank ' s request to double the ceiling of its calls of foreign reserve assets from the national central banks .
However , the fact that this operation is to take place so soon after the date when the single currency was launched clearly shows that the value of the reserves was seriously underestimated at the time .
Why ?
They all seem to be becoming rather more realistic again now .
The European Parliament ' s report seems even more alarmist when it refers in so many words to the potential instability of the euro which , according to the rapporteur , does not need to be demonstrated .
This slip of the pen will no doubt displease Mr Duisenberg who , for his part , keeps reiterating day after day that the euro is fundamentally stable .
Yet it is a revealing slip of the pen .
For it is , in effect , not realistic to believe that an artificial currency can inspire the same confidence as a currency solidly established among the people .
Mr President , on behalf of my colleague , Mr Solbes , I would like to make the following comments .
The Commission has been consulted by the Council - as it has been by Parliament - about the recommendation of the European Central Bank concerning further calls of foreign reserve assets to the ECB .
The Commission has therefore adopted a favourable opinion on the ECB ' s recommendation .
Should Parliament adopt the report of Mr Goebbels in its present form , this would mean that Parliament ' s and the Commission ' s views converge , which I would welcome .
Thank you , Commissioner Nielson .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 7.35 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , last night , we were faced with the unwelcome news on EDF ( German TV channel ) that Mr Hombach , the EU Balkans Envoy , has been placed under investigation again by the Public Prosecutor .
I call upon you to inform the Council of this and to urge it to relieve Mr Hombach of all his duties until such time as this investigation has been resolved in a conclusive and legally valid manner .
We cannot afford for the European Union to make a bad impression again .
We take note of your comments , Mr Zimmerling .
Yesterday evening after the votes in the Chamber , a comment was made which I would like to distance myself from and not to be associated with .
There was no mistake in the interpretation and Members of this House did refer to the Technical Group as the Technical Group of Racists .
This was an unfair comment .
No one could , by the wildest stretch of the imagination , consider someone like Emma Bonino a racist .
People need to be extremely careful how they treat other people in this Chamber .
Some people may not like the fact that the Technical Group has been set up , but it has been .
These Members were elected just like me and every other Member in this House and we have to accept that fact .
People have rights and I do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable .
We take note of your comments , Mrs McKenna .
I hope that the French State , the city of Strasbourg and the European Parliament will be able to take steps to put such small matters right in so expensive a building .
Very well , Mr Seppänen , we also take note of your comments .
Mr President , on seeing the Minutes , I am horrified to note that I have once again failed to sign the register of attendance , although I participated in a quite considerable number of roll-call votes .
I would ask that my attendance be recorded in yesterday ' s Minutes .
That will not be a problem .
Mr President , I do not have any comment to make on the Minutes , but I do want to say something about the European Parliament ' s information services .
I do not know whether I have picked the right moment to say this .
It does not concern the Minutes , but relates to something else .
Can I go ahead ?
I would ask the parliamentary services to look into why it was left out .
I can assure you that the services will look into this very closely , Mr Poettering .
Mr President , further to yesterday ' s minutes , I would like to express my great disappointment at the fact that even fewer than 200 Members attended the votes yesterday .
I conclude this from the minutes .
Very well , Mr Manders , we take note of all of that .
( The Minutes were approved )
Vote
Whether national or European , any central bank exclusively serves the interests of big investors .
Our abstention expresses our opposition to both the national and the European organisation of the banking system .
- ( FR ) The European Central Bank ' s proposal induces us to reflect and to act prudently on two counts :
It seems legitimate to ask ourselves whether we are throwing funds down a bottomless pit !
Consequently , another question arises regarding the effective use of financial resources .
Why should the Member States give up their resources in favour of a Community institution which , as a result of its need to be independent , cannot be controlled ?
In conclusion , let us remember that a State is not defined in terms of the sovereignty it enjoys as a result of its autonomy of action .
CAP : information measures
Mr President , I am presenting a report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation with regard to information measures relating to the common agricultural policy .
This report sets a precedent , as it is the first time that the Council has consulted Parliament on these measures .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has studied this legislative motion for a resolution extremely promptly and with great interest , and has approved it unanimously .
I would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by Parliament : First , in Amendment No 2 , rural information and activity centres are included as possible agents for these measures .
Secondly , the amendment refers specifically to the important role to be played by young farmers in the aforementioned measures .
Thirdly , we indicate to the Commission the value of simplification and cutting through red tape , both in the examination of the programmes submitted and in subsequent monitoring .
Fourthly , we single out countrymen and women , farmers and other parties active in rural areas as the ideal beneficiaries of these measures .
On examination of our amendments , it is clear that they have a human aspect and allow a far more dynamic , open discussion .
They avoid dealing with the CAP in a passive , purely bureaucratic and technological fashion .
That is why we believe that Parliament 's amendments improve the text .
In our opinion , these are proposals that should promote rural development and improve food safety and product quality .
The European Parliament would like the Commission to make these priorities , which are priority objectives for agriculture in 2000 , easier to visualise in these next information measures .
Mr President , that is all I have to say .
I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the support and collaboration they have given me at all the meetings we have held .
I would also like the European Commission , in one way or another , to take account of Parliament 's criteria .
Mr President , as high a priority as possible ought to be given to transparency and to keeping EU citizens informed of the work being done in the EU .
Providing factual and objective information about cooperation in Europe has become very important in recent years as we face considerable challenges with the extension of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe .
It is especially important to explain what the common agricultural policy is about and to provide information about objectives , resources and potential for development .
There are many target groups - farmers , first and foremost , but also people generally , as well as everyone directly or indirectly affected .
If this work is to succeed , it is important that cooperation should be established with the farming organisations and also with consumers .
The common agricultural policy was the first , and is also the most extensive , of the Community ' s integrated policies and it accounts for a very large proportion of the EU ' s budget .
This means that the EU ' s agricultural arrangements are of benefit to all EU citizens .
The common agricultural policy is always undergoing change and development .
Circumstances are very different from one country to another , and it ought , therefore , to be farming organisations which are among the main players , because these organisations focus primarily upon farmers .
Mr President , the purpose of information on the common agricultural policy should be to establish a strategy for communication , directed mainly at those working in farming and rural areas .
In our opinion , the main criticism of this proposal for a Commission regulation relates to the opening up of a budget line to non-agricultural organisations and also the reduction in budget appropriations to EUR 4 500 000 .
I therefore welcome the rapporteur ' s proposal that the Commission should match the budgetary appropriations to the numerous organisations that have a right to funding under this regulation .
However , another negative aspect of the Commission ' s proposal relates to limiting cofinancing to a rate of 75 % , when actions implemented directly by the Commission are financed at a rate of 100 % .
Hence the importance of our amendment designed to supplement the concept set out in the report .
With our amendment , we hope to see Community cofinancing rise above 75 % for organisations representing small farmers and family-run farms in financial difficulty .
We hope that this amendment will be adopted .
Lastly , it is important to emphasise the need for the Commission to simplify its administrative procedures both in order to study the programmes presented by the organisations and for their future monitoring .
Mr President , I welcome this measure .
From an administrative point of view the formalisation is a good thing .
But when we come to think about it the amount of money is quite small - EUR 27 million over a period of six years .
Considering the size of the agricultural budget and the fact that it extends to every corner of the Union , it is a relatively small amount of money .
That is why I welcome that fact that most of it will be spent at the rate of 50 % rather than 75 % .
The more of it that is spent at the rate of up to 50 % , the further the money goes and the greater the impact .
The common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism .
The long-term effect of the common agricultural policy in that sense will be greater than people have often imagined .
I have no fault to find with the way the Commission interacted with the agriculture industry over the years .
From my experience the European Commission was more open to representations and information exchange with the agriculture industry than most departments of agriculture in most Member States .
The Commission taught Member States over the years how to be open with very limited resources .
But there are new pressures , arising out of consumer concerns about new processes and systems of producing food .
These have to be explained , not only to farmers , but to consumers as well .
There is a lot of mythology about what is safe and what is not safe .
We have an important job to do to explain the workings of the whole productive system to the consumers of Europe and those outside the Union who will buy our food .
It is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this .
The last point I want to make is that , arising from these pressures , we will have a reaction from agriculture .
To devote as many resources as possible to good relations is a wise policy .
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur , Maria Izquierdo Rojo , and the members of the Committee , for their report .
The proposed regulation intends to provide the Commission with a tool to help it to present an operational model for European agriculture , and give wider publicity to the common agricultural policy .
In this way , the implementation of agricultural policy is facilitated .
Now I would like to speak about Parliament ' s proposed amendments . They are not generally aimed at changing the subject matter but rather at amending the proposals .
Amendments Nos 2 and 6 concern organisations falling within the scope of aid .
It is the opinion of the Commission that it is not necessary to mention the groups and organisations by name .
All agricultural organisations and rural players fall within the scope of aid according to Article 2 .
This being the case , the proposed addenda are unnecessary .
Amendments Nos 5 , 8 and 10 concern measures that are eligible for aid .
Amendment No 5 contains amendments regarding information services and fora for discussions for men and women in rural areas .
They are unnecessary , as they are already contained in the Commission ' s proposal .
One of them , which reads " supporting them in their choices " is not in harmony with the Commission ' s proposal .
The purpose of this regulation is not to offer farmers any special services . Local bodies are better qualified to do that .
The resources available would not be sufficient for that either .
I would , moreover , like to make the comment , with regard to the amendments tabled for Article 3 , that information visits are not being ruled out .
The list of activities that are eligible for aid is not exhaustive , which is indicated in the word " particularly " .
The Commission is prepared , however , to adopt this amendment .
The funding of long-term exchange programmes cannot , however , be accepted , as such action is not a part of the information policy .
That is why it makes no sense to repeat the contents of the model in further detail .
Amendments Nos 7 and 13 concern contributions .
The Commission thinks that it is not desirable to pay more than 75 % of eligible aid costs .
The funds available are modest .
The lower the contribution stays the more measures there will be that can be financed and the greater the multiple effect .
Amendments Nos 9 and 12 concern the allocation and approval of appropriations .
As we know , Parliament is a budgetary authority together with the Council .
For this reason , the Commission thinks Amendment No 9 is not necessary .
Amendment No 11 concerns evaluation .
The Commission agrees with Parliament on the usefulness of regular evaluation .
It can best be taken account of in the implementing regulation .
Amendment No 4 concerns administration .
This extra recital is unnecessary in the regulation , in the opinion of the Commission .
Provision for administrative details , evaluation and later assessment will be laid down by the Commission in the Implementing Regulation .
In this connection , it has to be said that the effective monitoring of public funds has to be assured in the process regardless of how open and simple the process is .
Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern linguistic nuances .
These the Commission does not consider significant , as Recitals 4 and 7 in the Commission ' s proposal are not as restrictive .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Grain legumes
The European Parliament has been analysing this proposal since October 1999 and approved this draft legislative resolution unanimously on 23 February 2000 .
I would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament .
First , Amendment No 1 on the inclusion of a Recital 2a .
This amendment supplements the Council approach , which is purely commercial , and opts for a proposal with wider economic , human and food quality aims .
Whereas the Council only talks about the market , the European Parliament highlights the economic interest for the Community of the production of these grain legumes .
Given the deficit of protein crops in the European Union , Parliament considers that this system should be improved without cutting the level of aid .
Secondly , Parliament ' s Amendment No 2 proposes that seed vetches should also be included in the aid system .
Aid for seeds already exists for rice , chickpeas and lentils .
Thirdly , Amendment No 3 indicates that , in our opinion , the Commission should , without further delay , make proposals for the 2000-2003 period .
However , this has still not been done .
Secondly , successive periods show that we are faced with a chronic imbalance in this system .
The maximum guaranteed area is being systematically reduced , thus penalising time and again the farmers who are suffering reductions in aid of up to 20 % .
Therefore , Mr President , what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament would really like to see is an improvement in the system .
However , we appreciate what the Commission is telling us , that this is a time of serious budgetary restrictions that we could not implement without reducing aid .
I thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their collaboration and support , as well as the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
Thanks also to the Commission for its willingness to hold a dialogue and I hope it will be open to our proposals .
Mr President , Commissioner , the report that is being proposed for approval today in plenary refers to a minimal reform of Regulation 1577 / 96 on aid for the grain legume sector .
So slight is the reform that it does not amend the total maximum guaranteed quantity , although it does split it into two , nor the amount of aid per hectare .
The only new element is the substitution of the management committee by the cereal management committee .
Nevertheless , I would like to make it clear that we have missed the opportunity to support a substantial , very arid area of southern Europe , which has no other crop alternative for its soil .
Our concern is therefore to avoid damaging the aid system for this sector of agriculture and , more specifically , for the production of chickpeas , lentils and vetches .
Chickpeas and lentils are two essential products in Spanish gastronomic culture and in our diet , the Mediterranean diet , which is now so highly thought of by scientists , which includes dried pulses in our traditional recipes .
The purchase of dried pulses in Spain has been increasing by up to 5 % annually .
Another sector which requires this type of product is livestock farming .
Finally , we are talking about Community protection for a crop which last year , in my region , provided an honest living for around 17 000 families .
Moreover , this is a sector in which , fortunately , there has not been a proliferation of bounty-hunters who move into agriculture in order to receive grants from the Union .
I am therefore asking for the support of Parliament for the Commission 's proposals and the improvements which , by way of amendment , are contained in María Izquierdo 's report .
I would also draw your attention to the fact that , in recent years , conventional farming has been put under pressure .
Prices have fallen for just about every product . This is what some people call stability .
Farmers experience it somewhat differently because costs are , of course , rising and price freezes will therefore automatically be experienced as a setback .
I would also recall the fact that the Commission has recently tightened up on the conditions for intervening in the area of grain .
The fact is that the system of aid established in 1989 has been modified several times , but no report has been presented on the application of the present system .
Finally , it is important to point out that it is vital for Portugal that dry bean should be considered in this system , even without the change to the maximum guaranteed surface .
We therefore firmly believe that the Commission should bear in mind these amendments to the new system which it hopes to establish for grain legumes .
Mr President , I would again like to thank the rapporteur , Maria Izquierdo Rojo , for an excellent and constructive report .
There are two Commission documents that serve as a basis for the issue of grain legumes .
The first is a report on the aid scheme in place for grain legumes , and the second a proposal for improved administration of the system .
What vegetables are we actually talking about ?
I know that the Spanish members know the subject well , but I should mention that by grain legumes are meant three annual vegetables with a high protein content and which are gathered in the form of dry seeds .
Lentils and chickpeas serve as food for humans , while the seeds of vetches , which to us are more unusual vegetables , are used as animal feed .
Grain legumes are grown as field crops , particularly in the southern part of the Union , as they thrive well in dry climates .
In fact Spain accounts for 90 % of all EU grain legume production .
Grain legumes are not covered by the aid scheme that was remodelled with the Agenda 2000 programme , although they can be used in crop rotation schemes involving other crops such as corn .
Grain legumes are covered by their own scheme where the amount of fixed aid per hectare is EUR 181 and the maximum guaranteed area is 400 000 hectares .
The scheme was established in 1989 when the growing area of grain legumes was reduced at the expense of corn , which was already suffering from overproduction .
The special scheme aimed to preserve traditional legume grain growing areas by means of the aid per hectare arrangement .
What are the conclusions of the Commission ' s report ?
An examination of how the scheme has been applied reveals that the MGA of 400 000 hectares has been systematically exceeded .
There are two conclusions to be drawn from this .
First , the aim of the scheme has been successfully achieved and , second , the growing areas have to be brought under better control .
The MGA overruns in the last few years have shown themselves to be mainly with regard to vetches .
Although the scheme is being applied satisfactorily as a whole , MGA management is problematic , as those responsible for the overruns are not being treated any differently from other producers .
So how could the system be improved ?
We should aim to find solutions regarding improvements within the framework of the present scheme and the appropriations set aside for it .
We are in a situation in which the Agenda 2000 reform has been adopted and international trade negotiations are drawing closer .
The other reason is that it might involve extra expense .
In addition , it is proposed that the Management Committee for Dried Fodder be replaced by the Management Committee for Cereals .
The purpose of this change is only to legally endorse what has become common practice on the committees .
Members of the European Parliament , in the light of my comments , the proposal will probably not be difficult to adopt so that it can be applied from the marketing year 2000 - 2001 onwards .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
Additionality
The next item is the debate on the following oral questions to the Commission :
B5-0207 / 2000 , by Mrs Evans and others , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on additionality
B5-0209 / 2000 , by Mr Davies and Mrs Attwooll , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the additionality principle in Structural Fund appropriations .
Additionality is meant to ensure that happens and to prevent governments from using EU funding to replace their own aid as this would defeat the object .
But in many regions and nations that is what happens at the moment and I can illustrate the problem using the example of Wales .
The granting of EU Objective 1 status to West Wales and the Valleys last year was an acknowledgement of the poverty in two-thirds of the country .
EUR 1.2 billion of European funding used effectively could provide exactly the additional help that is intended .
But if we look at the government budget to Wales , in practice there will be no more government spending next year with Objective 1 than there is this year before Objective 1 .
The National Assembly budget which comes from the Treasury remains the same so that in the first fifteen months , at least , of the new programme period there are no additional resources at all .
The money will be taken from other budgets in the National Assembly , such as health and education .
Therefore central government expenditure is reduced .
Under the Structural Funds , areas of greatest need are identified and selected on regional criteria .
Yet when the Commission looks at additionality it is dealt with on a Member State level .
This is a clear contradiction .
The rules as they stand allow this to happen .
Member States are not legally required to demonstrate additionality at the regional or programme level .
I agree with the statement made by Commissioner Barnier in a written reply to me when he said that the spirit of additionality rather than the letter of the law on the matter is an important consideration .
We need the revision of the system and a central part of that is looking at additionality internally in the Member States at the programme level as well as at the Member State level .
Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that Member States respect the principle and the spirit of additionality so that funds are targeted and spent effectively .
So we are asking in this question , Commissioner , for confirmation that this will be done and I look forward to the vote on this debate in April .
Mr President , the principle of additionality exists in order to ensure that transfers to the Member States under the Structural Funds add to , rather than replace , national expenditures on structural development measures .
In this way , European Union structural policies will have a greater impact on reducing regional and social disparities .
The ex-ante verification of additionality is at present being undertaken in application of Article 11 of Regulation 1260 / 99 . This is an integral part of the negotiation of the Structural Funds programmes with the Member States .
This exercise is a demonstration of the Member States ' intention to implement the principle of additionality over the programming period that lies ahead .
Where necessary , the Commission may request clarification from the Member States on the details of their forecasts for eligible expenditure for the period 2000-2006 .
As a further measure , the Commission has prepared detailed implementing provisions for inclusion in the programming documents covering both the situation ex ante and also the mid-term and final verification of additionality .
The second issue covered by the questions is the possibility of the verification of additionality at regional level .
I would like to develop a number of elements of previous answers .
In practice , reduced national eligible expenditure in some regions would have to be balanced with an increase in other regions in order for additionality to be respected overall .
A second point of clarification concerns the scope of additionality and the suggestion that , when implemented at national level , it may be incompatible with the regional vocation of the Structural Funds .
This is why the Commission takes the view that the strict application of additionality at regional level would lead to excessive rigidity in the management by the Member States of their own development expenditure .
Mr President , can I begin by thanking my colleague from Wales - though from another party , Jillian Evans , for raising this issue .
There are two major news stories breaking in the United Kingdom today .
Now these stories are not just topical background to this debate .
In my view , they underpin the very issues which we are considering in the context of Structural Fund spending under Objectives 1 and 2 in those parts of the European Union which are facing major economic problems .
As a direct result of what I would describe as UK government policy , our agricultural economy has all but collapsed .
Farm incomes are at their lowest level for a generation and this decline is also hitting the manufacturing sector .
I turn then to the central hand of Labour government at work in terms of the European Structural Funds package .
The unacceptable behaviour of the UK Government over this has already brought about the timely end of the political career of the first Secretary of the Welsh Assembly .
Sadly , the Structural Funds spending issues have been marked by delay by disputes in relation to matched funding and also in relation to the issue of additionality .
We reiterated the importance of ensuring that Structural Funds do not just merely , as it were , replace public spending otherwise earmarked for those areas that are lagging behind .
I am rather sorry that the Regional Policy Committee did not incorporate that in the report themselves , but there it is .
There are a number of questions that I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to take back to Commissioner Barnier .
I appreciate that he is the Commissioner in office today but he may not be in a position to respond to these points himself .
What progress is being made in relation to the approval of the programming documents within the Commission ?
Will the Commissioner take the step in terms of transparency of publishing at an appropriate time the correspondence that has taken place between the Commission and the National Assembly ?
We were assured , I am bound to say by a rather complacent Economic Secretary , who has now become the First Secretary , that all matters were proceeding in an orderly fashion .
Yet we hear from remarks that are made from time to time by the Commission that there are real problems and we find it difficult to do our job within this Parliament without that degree of transparency .
So , will the Commission undertake to make that information available to all Members of the European Parliament ?
Will they undertake to keep us informed in relation to these matters ?
Will they undertake to challenge Member State Governments in relation to the maps that have been drawn up in relation to Objective 2 where also there has been quite clear evidence of jerrymandering also .
The additionality issue is an important one , but I must say it is not the only one which gives much concern to many Members of this European Parliament .
Mr President , I should just like to touch on a couple of points that Mr Evans raised .
First of all , I acknowledge that there is difficulty in the Midlands with the Rover Group .
I would not like to make political capital out of it .
There are too many jobs at stake .
Secondly , he also mentioned their by-election .
I congratulate his party in securing a victory in this by-election .
But , unlike him , I have been in Ayr for the last three weeks , on the doorstep .
I can tell you that additionality was never raised once .
I turn to the question at hand .
I thank the Nationalists for having raised this .
It is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the Structural Funds .
But I suspect there is a deeper plot here .
What are they actually trying to achieve ?
I listened to Ms Evans .
Basically , what I took from her contribution is that she wants to redefine the Structural Funds regulations .
Is it therefore Parliament 's role now to change that ?
We should not change that .
The role of this Parliament is to ensure that the rules are complied with .
That is what we should concentrate on .
I know that Ms Evans , along with one of her colleagues , Dafydd Wigley and a member of the Scottish Nationalist Party , Mr Wilson , went to meet Commissioner Barnier .
I should like to read out the statement made by Commissioner Barnier after that meeting :
" I know that there has been a great deal of debate in Scotland and Wales recently about European regional funding .
But I have the impression that this has sometimes confused two separate issues - additionality and cofinancing .
I am not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion among the Nationalists on this .
We have always been satisfied in the past that the national requirements have been met " .
As the Commission will be aware , however , a number of Member States within the European Union have devolved systems of regional government .
Such regional systems of government are normally financed in whole or in part from central government funds .
It appears to me that , under the present rules , central government can build the EU contribution to structural funding into its calculations for determining regional government budgets .
At the very least , this engenders a lack of transparency .
It may also mean that the additionality principle is not being properly implemented on a region-by-region basis .
I accept , like Mrs Evans , that this does not , strictly speaking , contradict the letter of European Union law on this matter .
But , unlike her , it seems to me to be quite clearly contrary to the spirit of additionality rules and undermines the very purposes for which structural funding was established in the first place .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate my Welsh colleague for her excellent speech and I am also glad that there is basic agreement from all sections of the political spectrum .
Some of us newcomers to this Parliament are already beginning to tire of good intentions , fantastic programmes and of hearing about the spirit of the Community regulations .
Instead of spirit , we are going to end up with ghosts and sleepless nights because , in reality , commitments are not being fulfilled .
It is therefore appropriate for the European institutions themselves to start by making good their commitments with regard to additionality .
The Court of Auditors has already drawn up an assessment of the implementation of the additionality principle in June 1999 which shows that it is a total disaster and a mistake .
Scotland , Wales , the Basque country , Catalonia , Galicia , even a region as large as Andalusia , cannot depend on the decisions of a central State , however much of a State it is .
The first rules that need to be complied with are those in the Treaty , in this case , Article 158 , which takes the objective of economic and social cohesion to its highest level .
Our task is to ensure that following on from this , the Commission ' s regulations and behaviour attain and serve to attain these objectives .
Our task is also to be alert enough here to criticise and to raise the issue whenever we see that this is not being done .
We support the good timing and the reasoning of the issues raised by the authors of the oral question and we agree with the comments that have already been made here .
Similarly , we do not accept that the Commission should in any way associate itself with the degree of inertia shown by some national governments who are not prepared to support the regions with the greatest needs .
We therefore call on the Commission to ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I have been watching this whole business of Structural Funds and additionality for many years , and there are a number of things that we can learn from the past .
The first is that the money in absolute terms in most regions of the Community is relatively small , and its impact is political rather economic - though that is important too .
Even in rich regions they will appreciate the fact that the European Union tries to help close the gap between rich and poor .
The money is actually transferred and , regardless of whether the letter of the law is observed or not , the countries become the better off .
Another point that I would like to make is that we can learn from the past .
We are now into to the third or fourth programme .
What we must do is learn from the mistakes of the past and try and apply the lessons to the future .
In my personal experience in Ireland , I never heard the European Commission take Ireland to task for failure in the area of additionality .
But one should remember that , between 1982 and 1992 , the Structural Funds to Ireland peaked ; they are getting less now , and there was a generous amount of money .
But , from 1982 to 1992 , the public capital programme actually reduced , including Structural Funds .
It reduced in real terms by 30 % .
So where did the Structural Funds go ?
Mr President , I am going to refer to a subject that none of the previous speakers has discussed .
I am referring to the report by the Court of Auditors on the principle of additionality .
This is a report that was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 9 March .
This report contains a very interesting section - section 62 - that discusses privatisation .
Over the past few years , various European Union governments have enthusiastically embarked on a policy of privatisation placing the heritage which previously belonged to the community in very few hands .
Mr Liikanen is an expert in accounting , and knows that privatisation is a form of public disinvestment and , specifically , that it can be a form of regional disinvestment .
If , for example , an airline providing regional services was privatised , regional disinvestment could occur , and we would thus be infringing the principle of additionality .
Taking into account the importance of the categories of spending affected , telecommunications , energy , etc . , this simple operation can substantially modify the final result .
And we also have the response by the Commission , which must be very recent , and which Commissioner Liikanen , as a member of the College , must remember perfectly .
And the response given to us by the Commission in section 62 is very short .
That is , the Commission is replying using the Olendorf method .
We have here Commissioner Liikanen who knows the subject very well , and perhaps he could give us a more specific response , as I believe that this considerably affects the core of additionality .
The second issue is that the Berlin financial forecasts anticipated a substantial reduction in the Structural Funds .
This year we have EUR 29 430 million . In the year 2006 we will have a nominal figure of EUR 26 600 million , that is to say , a reduction of 14 % over seven years .
Taking into account inflation , I can calculate that there is a reduction of 20 % .
Mr President , Commissioner , as has been said here , EU funds cannot replace Member States ' public expenditure and the structural aid that runs parallel with it .
This principle of additionality is important to reduce regional disparities , which is the aim of the Union ' s regional and structural policies .
The Commission must oblige the Member States to work in such a way that the principle of additionality is implemented both nationally and regionally .
I suspect that this principle is being seriously violated in the Member States .
In some cases this violation is covered up by including as national regional funds development funds , which are mainly , however , targeted at the fastest growing areas .
The regional failure to observe the principle of additionality aggravates the situation with regard to internal regional disparities within Member States , which runs counter to the aims of the Union ' s regional policy .
That is simply unacceptable .
We are further told , however , that all is well , because the additionality rules in the regulation are being carried through properly .
And then two paragraphs later , the identification of the structural assistance interventions in the eligible regions is unreliable , and this leads to the inclusion of a large number of estimates and hypotheses which are difficult to verify .
' Difficult ' indeed , Sir .
No wonder that this causes disquiet throughout the Community and let us ask the Commission to give it its full attention .
I think we must look in detail at that problem , and we need also better coordination between DGs on this issue .
Additionality is your concept , and it is up to you to ensure that it works effectively in Member States .
We understand as well , of course , the problems you are facing concerning the overlapping of programmes , creating problems of continuity for you .
Verification is another matter that needs to be tackled with Member States , because they are guilty as well .
One of the worst offenders in this connection is the UK .
No additional money has been built into the budget of our Welsh Assembly .
This is clear non-compliance .
The European Parliament and the European Union admit that our nation of Wales is poor and yet the UK government , not only the Labour government , has not complied with additionality .
It is all very well for my colleague Jonathan Evans to imply that his party is not guilty .
For eighteen long years the concept of additionality was not complied with by his government either .
I think some momentum is being lost , Mr President .
I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday .
They need this scheme to go ahead .
It is in line with the excellent principle of cohesion , and we ask the Commission to adhere to that and to assist the poorest regions in the European Union .
Mr President , I had not expected to speak today because I represent the south-east of England which is one of the more prosperous regions of England and of Europe .
We pay the taxes that make up the grants that other areas receive .
We have no Objective 1 funding .
What Objective 2 funding we had has been reduced by the present government and the Conver Fund that used to be very helpful is now being phased out .
So , why do I speak ?
Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation .
In particular I want to speak of the Isle of Wight , a beautiful island with 130 000 good people but 68 % GDP per head of the European average - a very poor region .
It gets no support from Europe .
Why not ?
It does not get the grant from Europe because at NUTS II it is classified with Hampshire .
Hampshire is a prosperous county - 100 % of European average so , no money for the Isle of Wight .
