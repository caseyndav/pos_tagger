Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999 , and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period .
Although , as you will have seen , the dreaded ' millennium bug ' failed to materialise , still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful .
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part-session .
Please rise , then , for this minute ' s silence .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Madam President , on a point of order .
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka .
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam , who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago .
Yes , Mr Evans , I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .
If the House agrees , I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility .
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again .
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible .
That is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .
At the request of a French Member , Mr Zimeray , a petition has already been presented , which many people signed , including myself .
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .
Thank you , Mr Segni , I shall do so gladly .
Indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted .
Madam President , I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest .
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin .
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .
Now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing .
Yes , Mrs Schroedter , I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter .
But , Madam President , my personal request has not been met .
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well .
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors ' meeting on Wednesday .
It will , I hope , be examined in a positive light .
Madam President , can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998 ?
Why has there been no fire drill , either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings ?
Why are there no fire instructions ?
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident ?
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced ?
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .
Mrs Lynne , you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done .
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors , and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .
Madam President , Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President , Mrs de Palacio , which appeared in a Spanish newspaper .
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session .
I would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio ' s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November .
Mr Berenguer Fuster , we shall check all this .
I admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .
Today 's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
So Parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo .
As people have said , the situation there is extremely volatile .
There is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .
We do not know what is happening .
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?
In any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday .
Agenda
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday .
Relating to Wednesday :
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission .
I would like Mr Barón Crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it . That is , if he so wishes , of course .
Then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and , therefore , basically dictates this Parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five years .
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .
To this end , I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .
According to its President , it is in a position to do so .
Therefore , Madam President , I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , I really am quite astonished at Mr Barón Crespo ' s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on Wednesday 's agenda .
Mr Barón Crespo , you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday .
I am not criticising this ; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them .
Mr Hänsch represented you on this occasion .
In the Conference of Presidents , we had an in-depth discussion .
Your Group was alone in advocating what you are saying now .
We then put it to a vote .
As you know , each chairman has the same number of votes as his Group has Members .
There was a vote on this matter .
As I recall , the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions .
All of the others were of a different opinion .
That was the decision .
I should now like to comment on the issue itself .
We have confidence in the Commission and in Romano Prodi and , after a difficult procedure , as everyone knows , the vast majority of our Group supported the vote of confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission .
There is no such document !
The Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February .
We have said , very well , if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February .
We have agreed to this .
After all , we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission ; if at all possible , we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path .
However , we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission .
I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our Groups .
You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content .
The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together .
That is why my Group firmly rejects the proposal made by the Socialist Group .
( Applause from the PPE-DE Group )
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
Still on the subject of Wednesday ' s sitting , I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this ?
I do not know whether this information is correct , but the PPE-DE Group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already .
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda .
Thank you , Mr Poettering .
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request .
Madam President , I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering ' s lack of logic .
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups .
It is not a lot to ask .
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group ' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .
( Parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , 166 votes against and 7 abstentions )
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate .
Thank you very much .
Madam President , has my vote been counted ?
I was unable to vote electronically , since I do not have a card .
My vote was " in favour " .
Indeed , if we add the two Members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be ....
Madam President , the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote .
There is no room for amendments .
That did not happen .
I would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group .
This is an important matter .
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .
Madam President , I do not wish to reopen the debate , but I had also asked for the floor , to comment on Mr Barón Crespo 's motion .
You did not call me either .
I regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .
I am terribly sorry , Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox .
I did not see you asking to speak .
Even so , I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes .
When we adopt the Minutes for today ' s sitting tomorrow , then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .
This seems to me to be a workable solution .
Of course , the Minutes for tomorrow ' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations .
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes .
Mr Cox , Mr Hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?
Madam President , if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not , and cannot , object to that .
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote , I accept that but with reservations .
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes , as we always do , of course .
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .
Our amendments from the first reading have , I believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which I would urge you to support .
I would urge you to endorse this .
The renovation project , which lasted for months , cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe .
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit .
In fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .
All the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety .
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement .
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland waterway .
I congratulate him on his excellent report .
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible .
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .
Madam President , I would like to make a few comments .
I would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the Commission for the proposal it has submitted .
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .
This is a pity , in a sense .
This is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .
Furthermore , it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium , Finland , but also in Japan has shown that 50 % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment .
In short , the issue is an important one .
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year .
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these cannot afford safety advisors .
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .
The work is done . All that remains is the business of enforcement .
I would like to mention one final point .
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .
Madam President , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so .
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive , 95 / 35 / EC , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .
This , however , does not seem feasible .
Finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .
I should like to make just a few comments .
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998 , even though Parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .
This is not just the fault of the Commission , but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .
My second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .
In principle , I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules .
However , when it comes to safety , I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in Germany , Italy or Austria .
I can live with these minimum standards , but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully .
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .
My third point has also been mentioned already .
As you know , like Mr Rack , I come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries .
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .
Very briefly , I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission ' s priorities in the field of transport .
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .
Therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .
Finally , I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission .
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , Mr Koch .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Transport of dangerous goods by road
Delays in the CEN ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .
In particular , annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .
In this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94 / 55 / EC which has been tabled for discussion today .
The amendment to the directive on today 's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community .
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the Member States obtain more powers .
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own .
In so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999 .
The proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from May 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .
In addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC .
This is in the special interest of northern European regions .
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but I would ask you to endorse this report .
Mr President , colleagues , a happy new year and millennium to you all .
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .
The Commission ' s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions .
Consequently , I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods .
According to the Commission ' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient .
On the shores of the Mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .
There is support for the EU in Lapland also , so let us remember them .
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC .
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate .
I thought that it was quite superb .
This directive is a contribution to this .
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance .
Mr President , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , entail any major changes . Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU , both on roads and railways and by sea .
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind . In area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States .
This is extraordinarily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , Mr Koch , for the work he has put in on this issue .
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament , Mr Ari Vatanen .
In many ways , the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another .
By approving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union .
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .
It is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible . I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment .
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously .
For one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions .
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at ?
Mr President , I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport .
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation ( CEN ) has not been able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union .
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours .
A moment ago , Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , Mr Koch , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination
A major part of Wales , as you know , has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme .
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .
We have seen poverty growing in Wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen .
We are looking , therefore , within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality .
What is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government .
It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces .
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront .
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality .
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures .
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .
Finally , we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent .
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales .
Mr President , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , I will speak from the point of view of research .
This will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .
I would like to draw people 's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .
In the past , this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament 's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action .
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .
In her report , Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking , yet desperately needed .
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund .
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme .
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal presented by the Commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
This , as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , exacerbates the exodus from rural areas .
The consequences do not inspire hope .
It is the young people who are disappearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas .
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union .
Agriculture only provides 5.5 % of employment in the Union .
Furthermore , three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well .
Small and medium-sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .
Mr President , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , Mr Evans , of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status .
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party .
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality .
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation .
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines .
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector .
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future .
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the Commission or in the civil service .
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report .
She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .
We are badly behind now in this matter .
Hopefully , the stands Parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation .
For the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated . It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned . Projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .
While the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the Union ' s regional policy in general .
For us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .
This report is very good and our Group supports it .
Mr President , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions .
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator .
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .
We will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evolving .
This fact means that the European Parliament , the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically .
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .
I do not think , however , that this report has come too late .
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .
They need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for .
I would like to think that , given his previous experience as a regional President , he will agree to propose indicators , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas . This latter point is of particular importance .
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers .
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone .
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year , which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session .
Key EU programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe .
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date .
Mr President , on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues . This time , however , I actually agree with her .
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , I cannot say . Nevertheless , I would like to commend her on her work .
Unfortunately , this did not happen . Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament ' s position .
Thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far .
Personally , I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .
As an islander , however , I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .
Commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as Article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .
Therefore , the Commission should address the issue once and for all .
The time has come to implement the programmes , and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .
As for us in Parliament , I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May .
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .
Mr President , Commissioner , in this minute and a half I should like , first of all , to congratulate Mrs Schroedter .
Consequently , I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question : how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development ?
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us .
Finally , in this time of natural disasters , I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds .
As you know , it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation .
Europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations .
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .
I also think we should ensure , or ask Member States to ensure , that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .
Mr President , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .
As far as French planning experts are concerned , for example , the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country .
Well , the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process .
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator .
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds .
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level .
The Commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere .
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it .
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
Over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement , Europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy .
To this end , Europe as a whole , and each Member State individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the Structural Funds .
For this to be possible , what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States .
The report itself is well-intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability .
I would like to explain our thinking here .
Firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
Next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful .
Finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed .
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation .
I urge the House to support these changes .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work .
The European Union ' s structural and cohesion policies are , without doubt , essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions .
Despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment .
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines .
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life .
Mr President , Mrs Schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and I would like to congratulate her on that .
However , I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community ' s regional policy .
Quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravates it .
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the South .
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States .
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .
The Union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .
A large section of the Union ' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots .
Unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .
The first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously .
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union ' s fundamental objectives .
Secondly , I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention .
In future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the Azores and Madeira .
Mr President , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made .
Mr President , Commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .
However , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the Commission ' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .
Nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects .
I should be very grateful , Mrs Schroedter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations .
They are growing , but only in terms of GDP .
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions .
Commissioner , please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens ' greatest problem .
Please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require .
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable .
This means putting forward the Commission ' s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations .
This is the purpose of these guidelines .
Concerning the most remote regions , it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .
So that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .
You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines .
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date .
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time , however , Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted , in July 1999 .
Now to the form .
On the subject of the role of the guidelines , Mrs Schroedter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .
Drawing to a close , I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated , Mrs Schroedter .
I am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations .
I actually quoted the text itself , in quotation marks .
Moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .
You then mentioned , Mrs Schroedter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .
I find the opposite the case .
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .
Indeed , I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere .
It must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds , whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .
In any event , I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter .
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France , Sweden , Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow .
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms .
Indeed , this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms .
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union
The European Commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions ' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment .
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .
This , Commissioner , is the first commandment for the coming period .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it .
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union ' s regional policy aims . The report shows that growth has been uneven , despite all our efforts .
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences , long distances , climates that are too cold or too hot , sparse populations and austere conditions ?
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union ' s more remote areas .
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility .
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased .
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced .
In the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .
For example , uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .
In this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development .
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how .
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report .
Mr President , Commissioner , the European Union ' s regional policy has , until now , not been able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing differences in our inhabitants ' incomes .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Berend ' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore .
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boosting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified . I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report .
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities .
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions .
After all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all .
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer .
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation .
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .
In other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .
Mr President , my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report .
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union .
By stimulating a diversity of investments , the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment .
From the sixth periodic report on the regions , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .
As indicated by the rapporteur , the effects of the structural measures , on the other hand , are minimal as far as employment is concerned .
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for .
Also , the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions .
Mr President , it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities , especially in connection with boosting employment .
It is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit .
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , tying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .
Surely this must be the ultimate goal .
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions .
Following on from this , it is probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to regions , to give Member States more say anyway .
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States , we can avoid a great deal of problems later on .
Finally , I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries .
The report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind EU countries , especially in terms of GDP per capita .
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future , it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy .
I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later .
Mr President , Commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .
For example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect .
Equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries .
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base .
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed .
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .
This issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards EU credibility .
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided , I would say quite magnificently , the development of poor countries .
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago .
The EU really deserves such a gesture , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .
What is the result ?
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust .
Consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .
Most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised , if they were given the chance to , in other words , if there was work there .
We must give them this opportunity .
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have .
The solution , as I see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life , whether he or she is an employee , the owner of a business or an official .
What is a fair society ?
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .
In this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .
Mr President , Commissioner , as my time is limited , I shall get straight to the point .
Firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union .
The most remote regions , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .
In Reunion , for example , the rate is 37 % .
This is not a situation related to the economic climate , however ; rather it is a structural problem , created by our remoteness , our insularity , in short , our own specific personality .
The principle of specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299 ( 2 ) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases .
It only remains to put this principle into practice .
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January , then February , and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism .
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission .
As regards taxation , state aid , the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
Mr President , I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes .
I refer to item 11 on the order of business .
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group .
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this .
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission .
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships .
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday , I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly .
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation .
It should not be dramatised into something more than that .
Thank you very much , Mr Cox .
I understand what you are saying .
We have taken note of this .
Mr President , concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today 's agenda .
However , it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today 's agenda .
Mr Wynn , that makes sense .
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda .
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem .
Mrs Ahern , we have taken note of this .
I would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor , to the attention of the Quaestors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .
We will also pass this on to our services , however .
Thank you very much .
( The Minutes were approved )
Reform of European competition policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
Mr President , Commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union ' s competition policy .
However , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .
But , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper .
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy .
On reading both Commission documents , one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us .
It should continue along this path .
Only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon .
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , Commissioner , but there is one point that I would just like to go into now . Transparency and accountability belong together .
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question .
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .
Therefore , I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases , even given the Treaty status quo .
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .
With all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .
At the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue .
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord .
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .
But on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .
Competition yes , restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible .
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible .
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People ' s Party .
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors , according to various typologies , such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued .
This being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage earner .
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid , which may be assimilated in some way into state aid .
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .
This being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States .
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided , and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect .
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the Internet .
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting .
There is in particular one amendment , let me point out , concerning the energy sector , which , in my capacity as rapporteur , I see as particularly important .
I should like to conclude this presentation , Commissioner , by stressing two things : firstly , a concern of the members of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , in terms of competition policy and state aid .
And finally , in conclusion , our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
As you know , Commissioner , our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .
Mr President , Commissioner , my contribution to today ' s debate concerns the steel aid code , that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission .
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these .
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly .
Hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission ' s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in Parliament .
As in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 ( 1 ) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry .
According to this article , state aid is irreconcilable with the common market , in principle .
Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .
Under Article 88 , the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid .
In 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany .
Furthermore , the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 .
In addition , there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece .
However , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report .
As far as Parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired .
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe .
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years .
Consequently , Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations .
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind .
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission ' s supervision .
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires , steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets .
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions , I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves created , in plenary sitting .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .
Subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike .
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .
Subsidies distort allocations , both within and between countries .
A successive phasing out of State aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition . This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .
Public monopolies are , more often than not , phased out reluctantly .
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare , including within the spheres of education , health care and social services .
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .
Europe must be modernised , made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living .
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently . In fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .
The internal market is the basis for our work .
Its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled . The EU ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed .
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .
In order to be effective , it must be well anchored in the Member States ' national authorities .
In six months ' time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation ' s effects upon the Commission ' s role .
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests .
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for .
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us .
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings , at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points .
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .
In fact , in my own constituency of Stockholm , we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies .
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay .
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law .
Mr President , as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there has been a delay .
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau , Mr Langen , Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer , as well as the Commission , for their excellent cooperation .
All this is to the good of the consumer .
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points : dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .
At the same time , this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape .
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally , it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter .
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .
However , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .
One is subsidiarity .
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions .
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union .
I would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and Gütesiegel .
Here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention .
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although I am not going to talk about market failure just now .
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters .
These days , someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field .
However , I could also regard them as a customer , and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is evolved structures , stifle competition .
Apart from that , I could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields .
Thank you very much , Mr Radwan .
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak , inappropriately in your case , as a maiden speech .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member , Robert Goebbels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources .
While , since the dawn of time , the market has been the key forum for human interchange , it has never been perfect .
The market favours the short term and immediate profits .
On the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties , consumers and workers .
In order to function , the market needs rules .
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society .
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .
The market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators , but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .
Finally , aid can enable restructuring , offer training , save jobs and thus know-how .
The main objective of the Union ' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market .
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .
The Internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the American army .
The World Wide Web , which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society , was developed by CERN in Geneva , once again with public aid .
The German Government ' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism .
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund , LTCM .
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is , apparently , a sin against the market , but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market .
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation , as was the case in Mexico , Asia and Brazil .
Human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .
We Socialists reject the liberals ' naïve optimism on this point .
We want a true culture of competition in Europe .
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge .
Mr President , Commissioner , I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .
These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless .
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen : Holzmann , a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government ; sawmills in former East Germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyards .
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which is very important with a view to making the internal market work .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back ?
At present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment .
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .
Finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs , and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid .
You have shown us the way , Mr Monti , with the single market scoreboard .
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .
I very much hope that you , Commissioner Monti , will support these amendments , and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter .
To conclude , I want to welcome the Commission ' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .
But , as I have already mentioned , our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .
Mr President , Commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?
It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements , since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements .
So our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .
The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .
We feel this is relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything .
We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact .
Mr President , once again we are debating the European Union ' s competition policy .
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .
The overriding features of today ' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups .
Should we not be discussing this issue ?
We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies .
Certain sectors of European industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered tremendously .
They have lost their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant .
When will we debate that ?
The scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and Member States of the Union at that .
And yet , we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid .
At the same time , unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .
We consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the Commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .
The competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
Having said that , governing means planning . It also means being responsible and , in this new context which has been forced upon us , competition law naturally has an essential role to play .
Finally , on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty , we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction .
The Commission is , in fact , retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all .
National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control .
State interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers .
What is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .
Mr President , we are holding a special debate : on competition policy and state aid , the government ' s right and left hand , so to speak .
Whilst the EMU criteria are forcing Member States to curb expenditure , the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place .
This is understandable , because it is highly likely that Member States which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave , with adverse effects on employment .
But , at the same time , this is not understandable because bad management and non-viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers ' money .
In principle , only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort , or hardly distort , competition .
The rapporteur ' s Amendments Nos 6 and 7 , therefore , deserve our support .
Amendments Nos 1 and 5 make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society .
Vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit .
Market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies .
If this comes to nothing , then the government has to step in .
The Commission ' s White Paper on modernising competition policy seems more like a discussion paper .
This would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry .
Does the pressure of work within the Commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the Commission ?
What is the Council ' s opinion on this and is the Commissioner prepared to completely reconsider these points ?
Mr President , a White Paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave .
It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .
It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .
I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views .
I also assume that you , Commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .
I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner , but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless .
Firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application .
In general , I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .
The internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .
It is true , there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way .
The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .
But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward .
So , I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible .
Secondly , I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .
Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .
This instrument will fall by the wayside in future .
Thirdly , I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .
Fourthly , I would like to be informed of why the Commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules .
Fifthly , with the pending enlargement , I wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game .
They are still in training , as it were .
What guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market ?
Sixthly and lastly , I would remind you of a point that I have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions , namely the legal privilege of company lawyers .
If the Commission implements the White Paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable .
Is the Commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all Member States legal privilege ?
Mr President , I would like , in beginning my speech regarding the White Paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau .
The fact that the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure .
We are , therefore , in agreement with the report , Commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper .
Since the Treaty entered into force , Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy .
After almost forty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion .
For this reason , modernisation was essential .
That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons .
Firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralised application ; thirdly , procedural rules ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .
The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , academics and lawyers .
I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .
A system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or prohibitions , is something less than a valid system .
National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .
However , they could not apply Article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevented the coherent application of Article 81 ( 1 ) .
A reform of this point was therefore also necessary .
The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762 .
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .
The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994 , the Commission published a communication on this subject .
It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .
One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape .
As a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .
The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .
It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .
Secondly , Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation .
For these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .
Frankly , I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .
If it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the Commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?
Various arguments have been presented in its favour .
Because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market .
In that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the Union .
Mr President , I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union , when compared to previous reports .
I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur , Mr Rapkay , who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way .
I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country , which I represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .
I therefore believe that something is missing and I suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .
This is why I give this report my full support .
I would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for Europe ' s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in Europe in general .
Mr President , for British Conservatives the efficient and uniform application of European competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the European Union .
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .
The truth is that the single market is not yet complete .
During my six months as a Member of this Parliament , I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project .
We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe .
But all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market .
That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission 's proposals .
I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti .
We look to him as the man to root out cartels .
But he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination .
That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mr von Wogau .
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
So although I may not share his conclusions , I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address .
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
I know that the Commission is set against this , but the potential exists .
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities . I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court .
Well , we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment .
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment , in which we have the support of the Commission .
So , judicially , something needs to be done .
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .
In relation to legal certainty , I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen .
It is important that business has legal certainty .
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently .
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom .
We all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy .
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change .
We have been told how , currently , people 's time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .
But I really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .
Finally , we , as British Conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that .
Mr President , the European Union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since European integration began .
It is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .
We can be proud of a European competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .
We can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .
However , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits .
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s reign of terror .
Society is surrendering itself to the economy .
That is precisely what we do not want in the European Union .
In common with the other Members , I call for Parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .
It is essential that this long overdue step be taken .
It is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .
I welcome the fact that Commissioner Monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the European Parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public .
Greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .
It is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of EU enlargement .
At the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives .
A word on the White Paper : the revision of Articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .
The system currently in force creates transparency , affords enterprises legal certainty and has , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement .
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .
Indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the Treaty .
Mr President , I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions .
I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82 , especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .
As a Member for the Basque Country , I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market .
Mr President , Commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .
In other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics .
I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .
But a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .
I will give you an example : the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .
But these are competitive jobs , for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany .
It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve .
If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics .
Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power .
To that end , we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply .
Mr President , ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today .
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus .
This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe .
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top-up of 15 % for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000 .
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace .
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage .
Mr President , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe .
The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory , something I would wholeheartedly agree with .
But opinion differs as to the solution .
The Commission ' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .
In other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .
Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system .
I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .
We would be changing the law to make it executable again , which is something I consider to be unacceptable .
The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .
Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of Article 81 ( 3 ) of the Treaty on European Union allow .
The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the Commission will be completely in the dark in future .
This is unacceptable to my mind .
The Commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States ' courts .
But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy .
This is unacceptable in my view .
It would weaken a key element of European policy .
The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .
In any case , the Commission ' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties .
There was no majority for this at the time .
Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .
Forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of Europe ' s consumers .
I consider this to be unacceptable .
Mr President , in this important debate on competition , I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen ' s document on the Steel Aid Code .
As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996 , the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances .
Indeed , several years ago , this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector .
It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .
In the same category of ideas , it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies .
The Commission suggests shorter deadlines . I agree with this request .
Like the rapporteur , while I am pleased with the Commission report , nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way , the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code .
In the interests of equality , either the Code must be applied or it must be modified .
We therefore await , and I await , the European Commission ' s proposals on this matter .
Mr President , I am also going to refer to the report by Mr Langen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .
I agree with the rapporteur on two issues .
Firstly , I agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all Member States and , secondly , on the need for transparency with regard to this aid .
However , the thing that worries us most , Mr President , is the decrease in prices , by 30 % , owing to imports .
The reason for this decrease is unfair competition from South Korea and Taiwan , in the case of steel , as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid .
Orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically , resulting in a loss of jobs .
I live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems : Asturias .
With global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .
Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy .
However , it must be " europeanised " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .
I also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility .
I am in suspense as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .
The Commission report confirms that , with the exception of Germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .
The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .
As far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .
Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .
Take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24 % during the reference period .
With what aim ?
Not to save jobs .
All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .
Not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .
Did these firms need state aid to survive ?
No , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .
It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced , public services are being abandoned , hospitals are being closed .
Mr President , today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .
In accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .
Firstly , fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently , thanks to Commissioner Monti , there have been direct provisions , the code of good conduct in particular .
This has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film Casablanca ' time goes by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .
Firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .
It is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts .
This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities .
Fourthly , and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed .
We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .
The principle of competition must now be universal in its application .
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .
First of all the report reveals Parliament ' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly .
Many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .
For example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this .
Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective , uneconomic division of Europe ' s meagre resources .
The form the aid takes is important .
Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .
The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .
The European economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .
If competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .
Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights : we should not just be emphasising its social dimension .
The aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .
Mr Rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .
In my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr von Wogau , for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts .
Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment .
Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improving people ' s quality of life .
A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .
We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries , precisely so that their economies become less peripheral .
I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed .
Mr President , competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force .
A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .
In his report , Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well .
But Europe is changing .
The economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States .
The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy .
It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .
This is not in question .
Having said this , I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .
How will the Commission , as keeper of the Treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London , Palermo , Helsinki and , soon , Budapest and Ankara ?
This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented , and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given .
It is not enough to say that , in the Member States , there is already 40 years ' worth of experience .
In the Netherlands , the competition authority is still in its infancy .
This country has a very small market which , unfortunately , is often at the same time defined as the relevant market .
This in contrast to Germany , where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market .
Uniformity needs to be worked on .
Think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court .
This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .
Moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .
What is the Commissioner ' s opinion of this ?
I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses .
Through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .
It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .
But we all want to be oarsmen on it . We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .
I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform .
The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .
Firstly , there is the concern that some have expressed , in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath , President of the Committee on Economic Affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty .
I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed .
Secondly , we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty .
It is true , Commissioner , that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .
We all agree on this .
On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said .
There have only been nine rejections .
But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .
How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules !
This is therefore an aspect to be considered .
Thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law .
In this respect , the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon .
Here improvements should be made .
Only in certain countries , Germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .
Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore , but we must also explore others .
Commissioner , it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform .
It transcends competition , it transcends the cohesion of the internal market . I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects .
In my opinion , Mr President , this joint debate fully bears this out .
We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .
Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction .
I , personally , would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report .
The groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty . I will take these very quickly one at a time .
Efficiency : I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .
Of course we have pondered this issue , and we are still studying it extremely carefully , and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced .
At the end of the day , I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .
The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .
The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission ' s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .
So , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .
The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , permitting greater use of Community law , which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply .
Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .
The question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated .
In a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .
The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice .
Secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .
In this respect , I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation .
This then is the idea of monitoring implementation .
I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .
Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts .
That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns , Mrs Peijs .
Concerning Mr Evans ' point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .
The purpose of publishing the White Paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources .
We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business .
We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance . This was raised by Mrs Thyssen , Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : the issue of SMEs .
Many speakers have underlined this .
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs .
We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs .
Why ?
Is this simply a political gesture ?
No .
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations , as in the field of vertical restraints .
Most SMEs have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .
We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81 ( 1 ) .
( FR ) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .
The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined : the exchange of confidential information .
The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .
I will mention only two , in order to be brief .
The first is greater transparency .
Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , as I did right from the moment I had my hearing , on 1 September , in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American , Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy , and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation .
Mr Jonckheer , I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union .
I will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important .
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion , and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr Jonckheer , Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid .
I can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .
In connection with the issue of State aid , I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , among others regarding repayment of illegal aid .
In April 1999 , the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment .
In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report , which , although geared more towards a specific sector , is a valuable contribution .
When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form , I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .
I am especially grateful for all of this . We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs , and , at a more general level , with Parliament .
In this regard , I liked your term , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi : we must all pull together , preferably in the same direction .
Competition is not an end in itself , as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in European integration .
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the European integration process , as it has done in the past .
Thank you , Commissioner Monti .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Protection under criminal law of the Union 's financial interests
Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud , to detecting it , punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening .
Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring .
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed .
So far , efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success .
It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures .
Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States , together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement .
What is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this .
For it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 Member States .
After five years only four have done so .
This state of deadlock , which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union , has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor ' s Office .
We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .
We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment .
The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .
The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency .
There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States .
The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .
Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men .
The Commission , Mr Barnier , Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea .
I call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority .
We can set another example here , to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to mete out punishment where necessary .
Mr President , I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato .
If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought .
At the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community ' s financial interests , as Mrs Theato has explained very well .
We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community . But be careful .
The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly .
Mr President , this , as Mrs Theato said , is a critical report .
It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report .
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because , whether we like it or not , the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement .
It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is . We need to do something about it .
A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done .
We need to take this responsibility seriously .
We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union .
The question is : who prosecutes ?
That is where we really get into difficulty .
Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers ?
We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States .
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .
We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people .
But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions .
Of most importance to Parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the European Union , is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions .
At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .
People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted , and that is not the case at the moment .
The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio .
I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question .
We are aware that it is a delicate debate .
We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .
Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor .
But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .
Mr President , I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report . I think it is a first-class report which will , for the most part , be supported by my group .
I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .
Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .
We all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the Union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .
But the Member States failed to cooperate .
This is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , I think .
Unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a European Public Prosecutor .
My colleague Jan-Kees Wiebenga , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .
I think what we need is , at European level , to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible .
I myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .
This , I thought , is no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .
I would like to make one general point on politics .
Whatever we may say about the European elections , the low turnout is a fact .
We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly , and this must be done at European level .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur .
Mrs Theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions .
I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of , bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout .
Yet , every year we have the same problem .
The Court of Auditors publishes its report , which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud .
So far , however , the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied .
It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .
We will need the European Public Prosecutor ' s Office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for suspects .
Having said all that , I must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .
I hope that the debate will convince a few more people .
Unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity .
But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato ' s report receives more support .
Indeed , we are talking about criminal law , the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is , and will be , fierce .
Indeed , it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system .
Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .
In any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties .
Therefore , on behalf of my group , I would like to say that we support the Theato report ; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda .
Mr President , Mrs Theato ' s report on the protection of the European Union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor .
But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters .
Moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms .
According to the Theato report , the European Public Prosecutor is needed , in particular , in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office , OLAF .
At the same time , however , we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court .
In this way , a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one , and a medium-sized one may hide a large one .
I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform , which appears to be quite specific .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group , on the other hand , wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network .
And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities , for example , and the creation , if necessary , of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances .
So the legal framework , Mr President , is already in place .
It is fine , in principle . It need only be fine-tuned .
Mr President , Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .
Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI , the European police , in the form of OLAF .
And indeed there is a twofold shift .
Firstly , the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single VAT , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .
Next we have the Puritan shift : the Teutonic Europe of the North , the Europe of the Lutherans , Calvinists and Quakers , wishes to inflict its moral order on us .
Basically , the more we lose our grip on morals , the more we tighten our grip on our wallet .
Mr President , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the European Union , more so these days than there used to be .
The fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of Europe ' s citizens .
The credibility of the efforts we make here in Parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future .
This does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law .
The Intergovernmental Conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level .
When it comes to the demands made on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage .
Taking these aspects into account , I consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and I also consider it necessary to the further development of OLAF .
Mr President , will a European Public Prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving EU funds ?
I do not believe so .
On the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .
An alternative to the European Public Prosecutor could be Eurojust , as proposed at the last Summit .
In the way it is structured , Eurojust should correspond to Europol and support investigations into crimes .
It is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .
I nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most Member States should still not have ratified this Agreement .
It is simply too bad , and I can well understand why people are becoming impatient and demanding that we have a common European Public Prosecutor ' s Office instead .
However , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office .
It is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law .
Ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .
Instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .
We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .
At the moment , Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .
Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions !
Mr President , we all want to do something about combating European fraud .
But the question is now : is the European Union doing anything about it as well ?
The answer to this is that we know very little about this .
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime .
Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but , in reality , we have made little progress .
There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted .
So a great deal has to be done in this area .
And what exactly should be done ?
Two things , and Mrs Theato ' s report clearly spells these out .
Firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union .
So , unification in this small area .
The European Public Prosecutor ' s Office is nothing to be afraid of . I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on .
It is , in fact , something very positive .
Just like Europol .
Europol , involving police cooperation , does not rank above the national police forces , but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces .
This is exactly the task which a small , limited , European Public Prosecutor ' s Office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .
Parliament supports this .
The Committee of Wise Men supports this .
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same .
Mr President , I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .
I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue .
Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .
The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK .
The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about .
Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget .
We need a public debate on this .
We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed .
The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed .
There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .
It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate .
With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed , to be crushed .
Nevertheless , the way in which our committee intends to see this text through , with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair , Mrs Theato , will not be without its critics .
Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .
Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .
We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee .
We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .
I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community ' s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life .
For this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States .
In this respect , we are faced with the most sensitive issue : what role would a European Public Prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems ?
This issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .
Today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .
Mr President , I would very much just like to add to two particular points .
Sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion , but I digress .
The point I want to make relates to Mrs Theato ' s report .
We obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .
We also face difficulties with regard to offences .
Nothing has changed there .
As far as that is concerned , I believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .
Mr President , for years , Parliament has called for specific and uniform protection under criminal law of the Union ' s financial interests .
On the other hand , more pro-active attempts , such as OLAF , which is currently operating , have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights .
Nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .
Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?
Mr President , the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny .
Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged . To remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .
We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .
At the same time , we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way .
It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States .
We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework .
On the other hand , I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .
In the present situation , I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor , which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .
We have more confidence in Eurojust , where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate .
The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but , rather , that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered .
The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .
The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .
We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten ' s report .
The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .
Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .
The major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law .
This requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .
Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .
The Commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .
Parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .
The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation
OLAF , the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud .
This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and I hope that Parliament approves this step .
The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions .
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
In other words , there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on .
There is one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority .
No , there must be no undermining of OLAF ' s authority , and neither do I think this was the rapporteur ' s intention .
As such , I would ask you to give OLAF ' s work your full support , also in its present form .
Thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
VOTE
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
Heaton-Harris ( PPE-DE ) .
Mr President , on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure : namely Rules 133 ( 2 ) and 138 ( 4 ) .
These are both about voting .
That is quite right , Mr Heaton-Harris . I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call .
You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it .
In this particular case , I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .
Mr President , I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .
It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .
I know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?
I shall , I assure you , Mr Heaton-Harris , pay particular attention to the show of hands .
I hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote .

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Own resources
.
( FR ) The European Union is apparently financed through four own resources .
Since then , Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP , the taxable basis for the fourth resource , have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources .
Since then , of course , this Europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it refuses to see itself as .
This can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .
It shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the Commission .
Furthermore , the new Advisory Committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying Member States .
This is a long way from offshoots such as the " Community criminal code " , the " European Public Prosecutor " or a European police force , with OLAF .
There is as yet no federal European tax .
All the same , a Europe with 25 members will be wanting a European tax on income , if not on profits , or the tax on CO2 to finance the budget for 2025 .
Koch Report ( A5-0105 / 1999 )
- ( FR ) It is with great satisfaction that I welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods .
In recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .
It therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention .
Directive 96 / 35 / EC was a response to this requirement .
In order to facilitate achieving this objective , Directive 96 / 35 / EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training .
This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .
While this represented significant progress at the time , the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem .
In order to be realistic , I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force .
Koch Report ( A5-0104 / 1999 )
Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then .
I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997 .
This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999 .
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations .
This is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .
Right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the CEN will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .
Until then , there is really no point in Member States amending their national regulations .
The report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants States the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .
They may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation , where there are no applicable European standards .
They may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .
In offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , I wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .
Schroedter Report ( A5-0108 / 1999 )
Mr President , I wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the Schroedter report with regard to regional development .
I would urge both the Member States and the Commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in Europe .
Not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .
Despite the fact that the Community , through the structural funds among others , injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in Europe , these disparities continue to exist .
I regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .
I hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .
I want it to be clear that though I voted in favour of the report , I have this important reservation .
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000-2006 .
As a Member of the European Parliament for the constituency of Leinster , I have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national EU funds .
I believe that the Irish Government and the European Commission and different EU governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities .
I believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of European Structural Funds .
The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .
The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public , private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas .
This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit .
The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland .
During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006 , other EU initiatives such as " Equal " and " Urban " will be operating .
These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent .
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , European and local funding .
.
( FR ) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .
In order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .
But more especially because , even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .
Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities .
It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .
Mrs Schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .
This is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .
In order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include Members of the European Parliament , associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society .
These guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of Community structural aid .
Amended again as such by the Schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .
They also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject .
In the meantime , let us support this first step .
- This report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some Member States .
Although I wholeheartedly support this aim , I would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .
In my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping .
We all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .
If we are to have an effective single market that makes European industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all Europeans , then we must have a level playing field .
Illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .
There are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure .
In all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the European Commission gained .
Whether we are talking about beef to France or about backhanders to industry , EU Member States must not be allowed to flout the law .
I enthusiastically support the report 's proposal to publish a " scoreboard " showing the amount of state aid per Member State .
Countries that claim to be at the heart of Europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed .
Member States cannot be allowed to proclaim European solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling .
Much remains to be done , however , and I call on the Commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of Europe .
.
Unfortunately , the European Commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and Parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000-2006 does not carry much weight .
The truth is though , that the Commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .
In the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .
This is why the mid-term review , provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .
In general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .
That said , the differing approach adopted in the guidelines , which are not geared to geographical objectives , but rather to policy areas , can be considered as positive .
We could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .
I must also stress that once again the Commission is , in fact , skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .
In conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .
Berend Report ( A5-0107 / 1999 )
.
( PT ) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union .
We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues .
This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States , which is what the report proposes .
. ( FR ) The Berend report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the European Union .
Nonetheless , the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein .
Paragraph 26 , for example , " Draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union " .
Expenditure becomes an end in itself , evidence of the success of a programme .
The statistics published by the European Commission in its sixth report do however show , as Mr Berend pointed out , the limitations of the policy being implemented :
The poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment .
In 1986 , the average of the 10 poorest regions amounted to 41 % of the overall Community GNP . In 1996 it was 50 % .
Progress is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland .
This is a generalised tendency , sparing neither the Rhône-Alpes , nor Alsace .
It has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland , countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years , as in many regions of the United Kingdom .
Based as it is on such choices , it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union .
von Wogau Report ( A5-0069 / 1999 )
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power . A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today .
The management of ABB Alsthom Power , following a merger carried out in June 1999 , announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries .
This damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council , in existence since 1996 .
It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened .
It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .
Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect , I abstained .
.
This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States .
But it does , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the European Union .
Admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .
Indeed , the White Paper envisages that the Commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .
Moreover , the von Wogau report , which the European Parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .
But at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to Community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .
It is a quite different Europe which is taking shape in the long term .
Is this not , indeed , what is so distressing to some Socialist Members of the European Parliament ?
The German Social Democrats voted against the von Wogau report because , in their view , it might break up European policy on competition , which is to say , in plain terms , attacking the standardising superstate .
Curiously , a number of employers agreed with them , preferring the European " one-stop " system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .
Indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .
Rapkay Report ( A5-0078 / 1999 )
The Members of Parliament from the Lutte Ouvrière Party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on European competition policy .
Competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of layoffs , factory closures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .
We see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in Europe proposed by the corporation ABB Alsthom Power .
Eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the European Union , despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the European institutions intend to promote .
This is repulsive most of all in social terms .
Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity .
Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy ?
We are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .
Excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?
Finally , after Seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO ?
Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness .
Jonckheer Report ( A5-0087 / 1999 )
I am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this .
There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition .
Admittedly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .
Clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the European Commission .
The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .
This aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993-1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8 % to 2.6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .
This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder .
Like the rapporteur , I deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .
The European Commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .
It must also cooperate with the Member States in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the ninth report .
I think it would be a good idea if the Commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per Member State .
I also deplore the fact that the European Parliament has been totally excluded from the Advisory Committee on State Aid .
In order to compensate for this situation , the European Commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .
This is why I should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries .
Langen Report ( A5-0073 / 1999 )
In the important debate on competition this morning , I expressed my views on Mr Langen ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth Steel Aid Code .
Just as the Court of Justice recognised in its order of 3 May 1996 , the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation .
This , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth Steel Aid Code .
At the same time , it is , of course , essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .
It is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .
The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or , at least , annually , without the need for reminders .
Like the rapporteur , I am pleased with the Commission report , but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .
In the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .
Finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty .
The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .
My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code .
For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report , and I now await the Commission ' s response to our requests and demands .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Oil slick off the French coast
The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast .
Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission .
Mr President , I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , but also as an elected representative for Brittany , and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .
Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .
I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .
A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline , and why ?
If , I repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .
This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed , particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability .
Well , if the charterer is exonerated , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .
The regulations must therefore be reviewed , and I thank you , Commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations .
Moreover , as you said , monitoring must above all be stepped up : that of the flag state , that of the classification societies .
You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission .
What are the conditions for this recognition ?
What guarantees are there of its reliability ?
You are going to commission a fact-finding mission .
We await the outcome with great interest .
Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up .
This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries .
Why not ?
What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?
I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for , in this case , the oil company .
If the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .
Finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States .
Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .
I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes .
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain areas of it ?
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds ?
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster ?
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively .
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety .
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods . Just as the Sea Empress , just as the Braer did .
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
The time for resolutions has passed . What is now needed is action .
Sadly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .
Mr President , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .
The " Erika " incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe .
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds , perhaps mainly guillemots , may have died .
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic .
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .
With every tide , the volunteers , members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick , sticky , black tar .
When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident ? "
Indeed this disaster involving the Erika , like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey , moreover , is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available .
It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster , despite our saying at the time and many times since , " Never again ! "
It is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .
We absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .
Indeed , we must say and keep saying that the Erika is one disaster too many .
We should be aware , for example , that Shell and British Petroleum refused to use the Erika to transport their oil .
Why , in these circumstances , is the liability of Total as charterer not recognised ?
Your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance , at last , of the ban on degassing at sea .
A European inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .
In addition , it is also essential for the European Union to undertake to reform the IMO , as a matter of urgency .
What point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?
Finally , a compassionate thought for all the volunteers , nature lovers and bird lovers , who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .
I can testify to this remarkable work .
You are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick , which is a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .
In relation to this , you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces .
And , on this subject , Commissioner , you did not mention how the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats .
Once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .
In the meantime , it is nature that is taking the rap , as always .
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .
Our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .
Among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .
This is no longer tolerable .
Next , we have flags of convenience .
According to the International Transport Federation , over 40 % of the ships wrecked in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety .
This is no longer tolerable .
Finally , there is the lack of transparency .
Everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible .
This is no longer tolerable .
We must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .
Finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .
I am thinking specifically of Total-Fina in the present instance .
This is an approach , Mr President , which the European Union can develop with regard to the International Maritime Organisation .
In so doing , it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , is awaiting clear , tangible action .
In this emergency , in this ordeal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .
Quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .
It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies .
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .
Admittedly , there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund , IOPCF , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .
The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO .
It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .
Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the European Union .
In addition , there are Community directives , but they are seldom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspectors .
This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency .
A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .
The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings .
The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again . It is now scheduled for July .
The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .
I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .
Firstly , the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .
Secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .
Thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future .
This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .
Thus , the Erika was refused access to American waters .
If the European Community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .
Let us ensure , Mr President , Commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media hype and the shock of this House have died down .
Mr President , Torrey Canyon , Olympic Bravery , Haven , Amoco Cadiz , Gino , Tanio , so many names we remember with horror .
And now the Erika .
Whose turn is next ?
Twenty one years after Amoco Cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers .
The Atlantic West Coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .
And this is the result .
As an elected representative for the Loire-Atlantique region , unfortunately , I can testify to this .
There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters , they are the result of fate .
They are the result of human thoughtlessness .
What we have here is an ecological disaster .
Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series .
First of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .
Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission ?
Next , as a matter of urgency , we muss pass legislation , firstly , regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported .
In fact , according to the experts , the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast .
We know what actually happened .
Next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old .
We must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea .
This would be a minimum requirement , I believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group .
Mr President , in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .
It is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major European State ; an incident which could happen again at any time .
We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks .
The 15 clearly do not suffice .
These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things . No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again .
All those involved , including the transport agent , are responsible for any ensuing damage , and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances .
This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation .
However , we must aim higher in the long-term , let there be no mistake about that .
In other words , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .
Mr President , may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .
Many thanks for this .
This also means that , in any case , I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today .
The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level , nature and the environment come off second-best .
The damage suffered , also in ecological terms , cannot be expressed in money .
Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members .
What I learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .
Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner ?
First of all , the port-state control , according to which 25 % of all ships require inspection .
I think that this 25 % should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place .
So this 25 % should be increased .
But this is not in place .
Mr President , I would welcome some action in this area .
Finally , as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned , some Members have already mentioned just now that , since 1999 in the United States , ships should in any case be double-hulled .
In my opinion , we should look further into this point , and I also think that the Marpol Treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .
Mr President , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .
We have achieved nothing so far , and we have been unable to reach agreement within the European Union .
Allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe , which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods .
So what are we to do now ?
I have no intention of talking about past events ; rather I want to look to the future .
What are we to do now ?
I will tell you a few things we should do .
Of course , we need double-hulled vessels .
That goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term .
So what do we need to happen immediately ?
We need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate .
We need this at European level and internationally ; we need something like a TÜV , an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in Germany , which is compulsory every two years .
If you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .
This is what we need for ships .
Thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the European Union .
Any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .
We must reach agreement here , in all the European Union ' s ports , from Marseilles , through to Rotterdam , to Wilhelmshaven , Cuxhaven , and wherever ships drop anchor .
We also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability .
We need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability .
This would be a marvellous exercise in supervision !
I can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability .
Last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .
Environmental standards will be a recurring theme .
I would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .
The unions will have something to say as will industry .
A long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .
I am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement .
Just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .
We need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .
If we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time !
Mr President , Mrs Roth-Behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts .
We have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures .
But how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?
I would compare the situation with an earlier generation ' s introduction of the Plimsoll line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels .
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had ?
I consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that Mrs Roth-Behrendt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in Europe have brought up for discussion .
We must also critically examine the classification societies . I do not think that we can accept their procedures .
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .
Within the Commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .
It is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keeping with the Commission ' s guidelines , cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards .
I shall only add that it would be the least that Total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick .
How is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to divulge the names of the Erika ' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality , without governments reacting ?
They accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions .
In these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations ' capacity to cause damage .
Mr President , I am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies .
However , we must stick to the facts .
The ship Erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .
The answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken .
I have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the Member States do not have enough money to undertake the controls .
I cannot accept this .
If the Member States decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial , but include materials testing .
Secondly , I also share the Commissioner ' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .
If it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .
That is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt , we already have a TÜV ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .
There are reputable companies too .
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner .
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika .
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources .
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility .
However , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations , let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented .
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .
I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels ' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .
Calls for design improvements in hull construction , especially double-hulled vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet .
They are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection .
Mr President , I would like to thank my Socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .
These are the same areas , Commissioner , which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts , without any control whatsoever .
I come from a region , Galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways .
In this regard , the current process of negotiations on Malta ' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag .
On the other hand , prevention is essential .
Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .
Lastly , Mr President , I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities , who reminded me of old times when , as the then Mayoress , I lived through similar situations .
We must thank those who , while defenceless and lacking in resources , have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks .
In addition , I should like to make a number of comments :
First , the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA , the Italian shipping register , because we need to know if Community law was applied .
That should be the starting point for our efforts .
Once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .
Commissioner , I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .
I would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the Commissioner and some of my colleagues .
I am referring to the double hull , which consists of two layers of steel , with containers divided into two tanks .
Commissioner , I believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures .
It is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries .
I believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .
Any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .
I think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .
Public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common airspace , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area .
I therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms .
The Commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standards .
We sometimes regulate things which could , by and large , remain subsidiary .
In this area we must respond to public opinion .
This is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a peninsula .
Therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law .
We must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the ' polluter pays ' principle of responsibility which is , of course , supposed to be a deterrent .
I hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .
The implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the European maritime environment are enormous .
The cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker .
So people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods .
The International Maritime Organisation has issued international rules in this connection .
States can carry out port inspections .
In Europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25 % of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive .
However , it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .
It is clear that there is no lack of legislation .
In my opinion , the Commissioner is quite right .
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation .
But how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors , esteemed European Commission ?
Can the Commission provide an assurance that Directive 93 / 75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all Member States ?
Should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?
In short , to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements .
The Erika was built at a Japanese shipyard and is single-hulled .
There are four more sister ships in service at present .
Construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high .
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag .
Are we waiting for the next accident to happen ?
Would sanctions not be appropriate , as the Commissioner stated , for the classification society ?
RINA is currently the talk of the town .
Malta is entering the accession negotiations .
In my opinion , the European Union can only accept Malta if it is guaranteed that the Maltese flag will sail without an accident in future .
Like so many others , I too wonder where the people responsible are .
Where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur ?
Perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .
This is not the first time we have seen oil slicks , whether intentional or unintentional .
( The President cut the speaker off )
I would like to thank Mrs Grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before Parliament .
The environmental disaster of the sinking of the Erika off Brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the British media .
Although Britain and France have had their differences recently , I can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .
I salute these joint efforts to repair the damage .
This is clearly a problem for all EU coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .
There is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab .
Ultimately , the polluter must pay .
Moreover , although I am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , I believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .
I sincerely hope that , particularly during the French presidency later this year , the Commission and the Council will look carefully at all these options , and I heartily commend this resolution to Parliament .
The victims are waiting outside .
They want answers .
They do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through .
The citizens are right to ask : " do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? "
Who will provide us with new jobs ?
That is why I welcome Mrs Palacio ' s action plan with open arms .
It is equally important to note that " prevention is better than cure " .
But there is an art to that as well .
Deploying the German multipurpose ship " Neuwerk " - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help .
We are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew .
Valuable experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone .
We are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .
I have been fighting for a European environmental coastguard service for almost ten years , here in Parliament .
The issue is as topical as it was before .
Furthermore , I will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow MEPs , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of European and international cooperation .
They are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium . And therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that nothing had ever been done .
In fact , I believe that things have been done by the Commission , but there is still more to do .
During these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport .
That is the reality .
In my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deriving from American legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .
Flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .
The Romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections ; more than the countries with flags of convenience .
Malta and Cyprus have asked to join the Community .
We must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .
This will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the European Union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a Community register .
I believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the registers of the European Union countries .
As for the inspections , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked , as Mr Hatzidakis has said .
We already have legislation .
According to the information which the Commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many Member States due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .
Unfortunately , the 25 % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily .
Lastly , I would like to stress the issue of liability .
Not only in terms of maximum sums insured , which I believe should be similar to those in the United States .
We have set a figure of USD 180 million ; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .
Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problems .
I will end now . I will not expand further .
We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .
The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
We have taken good note of your intentions .
I have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present Commission statement .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
Storms in Europe
The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe .
Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
I think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .
In fact , we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .
We should therefore put this situation right immediately .
You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem , but also a medium and long-term one .
Let me explain .
I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20 % of deciduous forest .
Indeed , for some ' forestry ' districts , which have lost 20 % of their trees , this represents a huge loss .
The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .
I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues .
I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .
It is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .
Indeed , you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate .
On the other hand , districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer , as the National Forestry Office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years .
Those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .
I am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is , and I thank the Commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could .
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there has indeed been an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophes are still to come .
As you yourself said , Commissioner , these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes , and we think that these are the first signs of climate change .
We should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .
What can the Members of the European Parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?
Firstly , I would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who , on a daily basis , have had to reassure their constituents , organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services .
They have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens .
I would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .
We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local authorities and individual States from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying Community competition rules too strictly .
I am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .
As you said , Commissioner , we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to FIFG for investments that have been totally wiped out .
Beyond this , I think that implementing MAGPs in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected .
I therefore ask the Commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments , which they urgently need .
It seems quite natural that given such a disaster , national and European solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected .
These are the terms of the written answer you gave Mr Martinez on 11 January 2000 .
I can show you a copy if you wish .
As a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .
We must use the Berlin Summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the Union . That , however , is another problem altogether .
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium .
I would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated Europe in December .
These storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .
I hope you do not mind if I make particular mention of the forests in my region , Lorraine , which have suffered enormous destruction .
I would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but , unfortunately , their troubles are not yet over .
It is Europe 's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of Member States affected by the disaster .
I welcome Mr Barnier ' s statement and I also welcome the measures which the Commission has announced .
I am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this .
The Community action programme for civil protection , established by a Council decision on 9 December , was launched on 1 January 2000 .
I ask Member States to grasp this opportunity . This programme must work at full capacity .
Our priority , as we wait for Community-level funds to be freed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between Member States .
It is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads , and to repair them as quickly as possible .
Lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .
Finally , it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls .
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States .
This aid for gathering timber is , of course , only the first stage of an aid package , which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas .
I ask the Commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .
This is a very sad opportunity for Europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies .
It is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between Member States in the face of an ecological and economic calamity .
If this solidarity is to have been worthwhile , it is up to Europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry .
Current programmes must be accelerated .
For example , as they stand , the Commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under Kyoto .
The trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it shelves it .
The entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .
We must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the White Paper for renewable energy sources , as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases .
The new Commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate !
Commissioner , Mr President , Lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto .
However , it has now achieved notoriety .
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons , roofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest .
We have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate .
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany .
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days , then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual .
What would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an Objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?
All this is well-intentioned advice .
However , I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .
The thinning-out we need is not being attended to ; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree .
What we need the Commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date .
Mr President , Commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .
Firstly , at the beginning of 1999 , NATO , with the participation of most Member States of the European Union , flattened Kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom .
We are now endeavouring , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so .
Secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the EU .
The Commission in Brussels responded to the victims ' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders .
" We do not have the wherewithal for that , " they said .
This is wrong !
And no one can comprehend this attitude .
Certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss .
The citizens of the European Union expect solidarity , also from within this Community .
I say they have a right to solidarity .
Indeed the European Parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .
I urge the Commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms .
It knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations .
We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .
Then , for example , people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart .
When , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament , I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .
To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission , which will actually enable me to start work .
It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste , and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again !
Mr President , Commissioner , the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems .
It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters .
There have always been natural disasters and there always will be .
Of course , there is a need for solidarity here .
There is certainly a need for European civil protection , and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .
The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monocultures , if we are talking forests .
Of course , I am in favour of providing assistance where we can .
But when it comes to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground .
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monocultures .
The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .
To this day , we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream , and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff .
America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go .
We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream .
But in common with others , we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect .
This is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .
We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference .
We must reduce CO2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make enquiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of Europe are faring .
Mr President , I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims .
This is an irreparable loss .
Secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens , and the solidarity of other countries with France , which is the country worst affected .
As I have little time , Mr President , I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution .
I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not .
That is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .
In fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .
Therefore Europe must be clearly committed to the Kyoto Protocol and make specific proposals .
Secondly , I was rapporteur for civil protection in Europe and I completely agree with the Commissioner ' s proposal to create a European civil protection body .
Furthermore , we should utilise an extraordinary budget line , since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation .
First of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy .
It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards .
It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .
That is important .
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past . It was very small .
It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major .
Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels , whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies .
So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .
I think we should reinstate this budget line .
When we had the earthquake in Greece , which was a big disaster , the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks .
The same when the floods came in France and the same again now .
These are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .
We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument .
We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it .
We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic .
We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these .
Ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .
It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines .
It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul .
I would like to tell Commissioner Barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly European in spirit .
Mr President , Commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation , we see that Europe gets off relatively lightly .
Nevertheless , the storms that took place in the last week of December showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .
Anyone travelling to Strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in Alsace as well .
Each and every one of us knows that any other region of Europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow .
What we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .
For it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .
For instance , it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the bark beetle ' s larvae , and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have .
That is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives .
Decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry .
For we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .
The calculations are in decades rather than years .
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared .....
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms .
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .
We had very little coverage in Ireland of the tanker that sank .
I was asked to highlight the result of the storms in Ireland .
We had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of acres being submerged , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .
We experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of E.coli-infected water .
I talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water .
Natural habitats were destroyed .
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case .
I thank the Commissioner and support him very much in his European protection force .
Mr President , Commissioner , I second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .
I would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout Europe .
Unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .
As has already been mentioned here , there are indications - no proof , but clear indications - that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe .
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
That concludes the debate .
The vote will be taken at noon on Thursday .
Food safety
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission .
At my hearing last September , I promised speedy delivery of this White Paper .
I am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .
The White Paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new Commission was appointed last September .
It takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the Commission 's Green Paper on food law was published .
Equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge , as well as the BSE crisis .
The White Paper also reflects the concerns of this Parliament which you have outlined to both President Prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this House since the Commission was appointed .
I do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in Europe 's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months .
The Commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world .
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth .
The most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of Europe .
If their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions .
This in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually , even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects .
Between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .
High levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .
In saying all of this , I would like to make it clear that Europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems .
The challenge is to make the system the very best .
The overall objective therefore of the White Paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .
We are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .
The Commission will need the full support of Parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .
We will also need the fullest support from the Council and other key stakeholders .
The White Paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing EU food legislation . All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .
We want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .
The detailed action plan on food safety in the White Paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .
Over 80 measures are envisaged .
Our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 2002 .
We are also envisaging the establishment of a European food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .
This idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .
It has already attracted much comment , including reactions from Members of Parliament .
The chapter of the White Paper devoted to the establishment of a European food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments . We are seeking views by the end of April on what we envisage .
I will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .
The Commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .
Why should a European food authority be an essential part of that structure of change ?
The first key concern is independence .
Key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests .
We must also ensure excellence and transparency .
We have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the BSE crisis .
However , the Commission believes that we must go further .
We must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .
The key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .
We envisage that the work of the existing five Scientific Committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .
They may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority 's establishment .
However , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs , this would clearly not be enough .
As the White Paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value-added structure .
I am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .
Within the authority I envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .
This proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .
To be proactive the White Paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority .
These include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the EU , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in Member States .
As part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .
The Commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .
We believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
I make no apology for this approach ; I firmly believe that it is the correct one .
Certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority .
I do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .
It was only last year that the Treaty was amended to give Parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .
To give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .
I will be very interested to hear the views of Parliament itself in relation to this matter .
There are also those who argue that the Commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .
I also reject this line of argument . How could a Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?
Would this be in the interests of Europe 's citizens ?
In my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based , rationally argued and fully justified .
It seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .
I can assure you here today that the Commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States .
This is a major task .
We must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the European Union .
The authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .
This situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself .
I do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science .
However , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre-eminent on the European stage .
I am also anxious to hear the views of Parliament in this regard .
The White Paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .
This is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that Member States and operators are complying with Community legislation .
I want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .
In this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in Dublin .
This revised Community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at Community level , Community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .
These proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world , boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the Union .
It sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation .
The new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , contaminants and residues , novel food , additives , flavourings , packaging and irradiation .
As regards the precautionary principle , I might add that the Commission is currently finalising a communication which I expect to be adopted very soon .
However , having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees , I recognise that this was not feasible .
But I know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the White Paper 's proposals on the authority .
We now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the Commission 's ideas on the White Paper on the establishment of a European food authority .
Parliament will have a key part to play in this debate . Parliament played a crucial role in Europe 's response to the BSE crisis .
It has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore .
I expect that Parliament 's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .
While we have a number of months to the end of April to debate the issue and garner our views , I recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .
I would therefore ask Parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .
The European food authority will be a key ingredient in the EU 's food safety regime in the years ahead .
It is essential that we get the mix right .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for his statement .
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions , including the Commission and Parliament .
That is very much the right approach .
But there is one word that I have not heard you mention here tonight . I hope that we can thrash this out .
We need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .
It is very important that we include liability in that process .
That is the one word I am talking about .
The problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .
That cannot continue .
When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .
Mr President , it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .
My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .
You are unclear about this in your White Paper .
What is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?
When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?
The final part of my question is as follows : when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States ?
That is another point , i.e. the question of obligation , which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your statement .
I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality .
The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .
Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .
Secondly , will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States ? We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .
President , first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern , Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper .
I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .
Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability .
That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .
Once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .
I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .
But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration .
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .
That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .
At the moment the list is , as I say , a negative list and it is added to as required .
The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .
The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .
Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .
This is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .
I hope that the next time you ask me the question , I will be in a position to give you more detailed information .
Mrs Jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation .
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .
There is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .
Standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that I have drawn to the attention of Mr Verheugen .
Of course , we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content , but I would insist on Parliament retaining the rights accorded it under Maastricht and Amsterdam , and even extending them .
I also welcome the White Paper .
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France 's refusal to lift the ban ?
You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting .
Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment ?
For example , the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .
All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union .
I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?
In addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .
You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .
This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months .
I envisage that the board 's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .
Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September .
We have not done that yet but it will be done in September .
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work .
That would erode the independence of the scientific advice .
But it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research .
Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that .
That is an issue for consideration and discussion .
There may be a number of views on that .
Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board .
Others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if Parliament , through nominees or even MEPs themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .
It is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .
Mr Florenz also raised the question of anonymity .
I am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .
It must be visible . It must be known .
Consumers in the European Union must know of the existence of the food authority .
They will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority .
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous .
It must be visible .
I will do everything I can to promote that high profile role for the authority .
Mrs Lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .
I suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in Member States begin and end .
There would have to be an interaction at scientific level .
Quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advising , the food safety authority at Community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at Member State level .
That is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .
There are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .
But information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern .
This situation can be achieved over a period of time .
You cannot legislate for consumer confidence .
It is something that is earned over a period of time .
However , the Commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the Authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the Commission , Parliament and Council .
I realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward .
Any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .
One of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .
I hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .
In relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .
It will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with Community law pending a court ruling .
In relation to Mrs Lynne 's question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues .
Mrs Myller then asked me about the location of the Authority .
No decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the Authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery .
I recognise that the FEO is located in Dublin and , although I come from that part of the world myself , I have to accept that it is not the centre of Europe !
But the FVO is in quite a different situation from the Food Safety Authority .
The FVO is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in Dublin .
The Food Safety Authority 's situation is quite different .
It has to be close to the Commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the Food Safety Authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation .
Equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified .
It seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .
That is my judgement at the moment .
Colleagues , I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda .
I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents .
If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important , I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them .
On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner , and his statement .
As you can see , half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .
I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions .
That concludes the debate .
Question Time ( Commission )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0003 / 2000 ) .
We will examine questions to the Commission .
We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time .
We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session .
Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion .
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda .
The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m. , and you can see the clock .
I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .
First Part
Question No 28 by ( H-0781 / 99 ) :
Mr Verheugen has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The Commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu , Turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .
According to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet .
The Commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .
In particular , the Commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the Ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .
Large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .
The Commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material .
It acknowledges the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Thank you for your reply .
I should like to make the following points : Turkey is now a candidate country .
This plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .
At the same time , it also wishes to acquire Cadou type reactors from Canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in Pakistan and India .
In this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the Caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology .
So much for the political aspect .
Now to the technical aspect .
The safety factor in this type of project , and I am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .
In cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simulators are used .
However , we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy .
In this sense , all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this .
A couple of weeks ago we had a debate in Parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .
I have explained the position of the Commission .
You have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .
So what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable .
In the case of Turkey it is different .
The plant is not yet there .
I have already said that Turkey is part of the NPT and of the Convention on Nuclear Safety .
If we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with Turkey .
I think it is the right of a Member of Parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .
I do not have these concerns .
Question No 29 by ( H-0786 / 99 ) :
Subject : Depleted uranium weapons Has the Commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon EU states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Kosovan conflict ?
If not , why not ?
Mrs Wallström has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
Thank you , Mr Bowe , for your question .
The European Commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the NATO action .
As early as last June the Commission financed a first study .
It was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern Europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe .
None of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment .
The Commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the United Nations environment programme - Balkan Task Force .
This is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the Kosovo conflict and I recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .
The use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the Net .
The Balkan Task Force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .
No indications of contamination were found in Kosovo during the BTF fact-finding mission .
However , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in Kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .
From a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .
Future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern Europe .
A special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed . It will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .
First of all , Mr President , can I thank the Commissioner for that very useful response .
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .
But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .
This uranium becomes air-borne , is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war .
How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?
Thank you , Mr Bowe , for that question .
We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo .
But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .
That is also mentioned in the report .
No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .
A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .
It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .
Mr President , Commissioner , in a few months ' time , hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday .
We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast .
Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ?
I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to .
We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .
That is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .
What we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .
In the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .
That also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .
Unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise .
I cannot answer that question .
When it comes to medical checks and so on , I do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer .
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that .
Of course I can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .
Question No 30 by ( H-0793 / 99 ) :
Subject : Appointment of a European Union envoy for Tibet In 1998 the Tibetan Government in exile received over 4000 Tibetans who escaped over the Himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .
Many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way .
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet ?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared .
I have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including Tibet , firmly and candidly to the Chinese authorities .
The European Union did that at the European Union ­ China Summit in Peking last month where we pressed the Chinese on a number of human rights issues , including Tibet .
We again urged the Chinese to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
I urge the Chinese again to do so .
We will continue to raise Tibet with the Chinese authorities .
The appointment of an EU special envoy for Tibet would be primarily a matter for the Council to decide and Parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .
But for my part , I am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .
It would be unlikely to have much impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the Tibetan community in exile .
I am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause .
Imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum .
If we cut down here and say that the Council now shares responsibility for this , then I fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .
Let me make clear to the honourable Member what the position is .
I stated nothing but the truth when I said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the Council .
As it happens , we deal with the budgetary consequences , the Council makes the appointment .
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .
Putting that on one side , because that is the situation , it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues .
I have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently - everywhere in the world .
I repeat that we have made our position known to the Chinese on Tibet .
Mr President , I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting , which betokens peace and happiness .
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness , the Dalai Lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair ?
I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people .
I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition .
Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama .
It is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .
The Commission , like others , has urged dialogue .
The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .
I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama .
At or around the time of President Clinton 's visit to China , the President of the People 's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .
Question No 31 by ( H-0795 / 99 ) :
Are these reports accurate ?
What is the reason for the Commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration ?
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .
In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure .
At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .
The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading .
It should be noted that the new Commission gave an immediate follow-up to the European Ombudsman decision of 28 July 1999 in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code .
The Commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the European Ombudsman .
The code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the Commission 's administration with the public .
It will be adopted through a legally-binding Commission decision to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities .
The document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the European Ombudsman 's office .
According to the related provisions in the Treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its Rules of Procedure is the Commission itself .
However , it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner .
However , I would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .
The newspaper reports were misleading .
I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman .
There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that .
I want to repeat that honourable Members , like the honourable Member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member .
I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer .
Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?
Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true !
" I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman 's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999 " .
Both documents , that is the Commission 's document and the Ombudsman 's draft , cover largely the same ground .
The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .
I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue .
We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten ' s notes into the bibliography , as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind .
As the author is not present , Question No 32 lapses .
I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy . I am sorry .
According to the Rules of Procedure , you are not required to reply .
I wish you a good evening .
Second Part
Questions to Mr Nielson , who is replaced by Mr Patten
Questions 33 and 34 of Questions to the Commission were intended for Mr Nielson .
Mr Nielson cannot be present today since he is in South Africa .
I must tell you that the Vice-President of the Commission , Mrs Loyola de Palacio , has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that Mr Patten will reply to the questions .
Question No 33 by ( H-0829 / 99 ) :
Subject : ' Mainstreaming ' in EU aid policy In 1995 the Council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ( ' mainstreaming ' ) into the full range of EU aid policy .
' Mainstreaming ' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy , strategy and measures .
To achieve that , the Council 's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety .
Current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and 1-2 days ' training in such issues should form an essential part of the Directorate-General for Development 's introductory courses for new staff .
Is the Commission prepared to take such measures ?
The training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .
The training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .
As far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .
My own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on .
The quest for equality should permeate the work of the Directorate-General for Development at all levels . It is not to be brought in as a " sort of optional add-on " .
This must naturally lead to a reformulation of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .
In addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .
Equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals , action plans and strategies .
It would appear that we are in agreement about this .
However , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers .
If the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .
Extremely few members of the Directorate-General for Development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .
Only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .
That is naturally unacceptable .
What is the Commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .
This limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .
As I point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .
My question is this : is the Commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the Directorate-General for Development ?
Well I certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague Commissioner Nielson .
And , since it should be essential , I would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .
That goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority .
It is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves .
So I sympathise very much with what the honourable Member has said .
I hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .
Since 1991 , the Community has provided significant financial support to the New Independent States including the countries of central Asia .
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme .
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million .
This assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions .
Security considerations have prevented Tajikistan from benefiting fully from TACIS but a rehabilitation programme of EUR 7.2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .
In addition to national programmes , the European Union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .
Food security programmes in central Asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the European Union provided food aid in kind .
These programmes have benefited Kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , Tajikistan .
Funding for NGO programmes in Tajikistan amounted to EUR 7.42 million in 1998 and 1999 .
Over the same period , Kyrgyzstan received EUR 17 million .
Since 1993 the Commission 's European Community Humanitarian Office , ECHO , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan .
In 1998 and 1999 EUR 3.8 million was granted to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received over EUR 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and sanitation .
Frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that European Union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .
Mr President , Commissioner , there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century .
That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular .
We were able , at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics .
I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .
I can send the honourable Member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics .
Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side .
But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia .
I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well .
So the honourable Member 's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .
We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact .
Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation .
Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land .
There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .
We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner ' s answer .
This is not the usual state of affairs .
And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time .
Thank you very much , Mr Patten , for your interventions today .
Question No 35 by ( H-0778 / 99 ) :
As far as Mr Papayannakis ' question is concerned , in the 1999 Action Plan for Employment , the Commission proposed certain recommendations for Greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the Action Plan for Employment .
The Greek Government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : " Yes to Work " and " Back to Work " .
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved .
The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made .
Thank you , Commissioner for your reply .
You tell me that you , as the Commission , have made recommendations .
I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to .
However , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?
Did anyone find work ?
How many people found work ?
If you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .
What has been done about training ?
Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees ?
Do we have any figures ?
In other words , do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece ?
Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and , as far as I can see , an increase in productivity .
The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines .
As you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated .
They concern access to training , the ratio of men to women with access to training , and special action for the long-term unemployed .
The Commission will endeavour , for all these specific guidelines , to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006 .
Question No 36 by ( H-0782 / 99 ) :
The Danish pension scheme , the Efterløn , only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire .
Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire .
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law .
The Commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the Danish Government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .
The last meeting on the subject was held in November 1999 and we are waiting for the Commission services ' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against Denmark .
I should like to ask the Commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the Commission .
I should like to ask the Commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter , for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the Danish socio-political debate .
So I should be grateful if the Commissioner could enlarge upon this question .
Honourable Member , I should just like to stress that both Denmark and numerous other Member States are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law .
I think that the answer is brief and clear .
Of course it is as you say .
There will be no problem with Danish nationals within Denmark , that is not where the problem lies .
The problem is with Danish nationals or other nationals residing outside Denmark .
Question No 37 by ( H-0791 / 99 ) :
A proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors .
The content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors , with the possibility , following negotiation , of increasing it to 54 hours .
The Council , Commission and Parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .
Parliament has proposed 4 years , the Commission 7 and the Council 13 .
This proposal is still being discussed by the Council and Parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .
Question No 38 by ( H-0805 / 99 ) :
Subject : Measures to advance gender equality One of the working groups of Commissioners announced by President Prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality ( gender mainstreaming ) .
Which Commissioners are members of this group ?
How many meetings of the group have been held to date ?
What concrete measures have been discussed ?
This question covers several individual matters .
It refers to the special Commission working group dealing with questions of equality .
The Commissioners taking part are President Prodi , Vice-President Kinnock , Mr Reding and myself .
The meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on 11 January 2000 .
Mrs Avilés-Perea , that was an exhortation rather than a question .
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...
Allow me to say just one word . I agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .
Question No 39 by ( H-0807 / 99 ) :
Under this umbrella , each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country .
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States ' programmes ?
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly ?
The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .
Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace .
The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .
This is an important aspect of this initiative .
The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation .
This is the same as the Social Fund regulation , i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation .
It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament ' s opinion next month .
I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy .
The Member States , i.e. the national governments , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies , submitting proposals , selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control .
Within the European Commission , the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation , while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control , the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors .
The last question concerns the amount granted .
Greece has been granted ECU 98 million .
The contribution commitment is 80 % , rising to an 85 % contribution from the initiative for the island regions , especially the remote Greek islands , and a contribution by Greece of 15 % .
Mr President , I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative , especially the four actions described in it , will result both in complicated bureaucracy and , paradoxically , a non-transparent structure .
For example , one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines .
However , this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas .
However , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminated against , such as asylum seekers , immigrants and so on , is rendered impossible or merely symbolic .
Secondly , I have to say that the aim of the EQUAL initiative is not to reduce unemployment , it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment , or to support an increase in employment .
That is the job of the European Strategy for Employment and the Social Fund , which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal , especially for countries like Greece .
The EQUAL initiative has a specific mission .
To encourage , to assist promotion , to create statistics , to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination .
Question No 40 by ( H-0808 / 99 ) :
Subject : Article 13 TEU and Employment The draft Commission Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation gives exemption to religious organisations ( Art. 4.2 ) .
Could the Commission please tell Parliament the circumstances and the groups within Article 13 ( TEU ) likely to be effected by such an exemption ?
A month ago , the Commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescribed in the Treaty , in order to implement Article 13 .
The ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted .
At the Commission ' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies , Member States and the European Parliament , a number of exceptions have been made .
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .
Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .
In a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .
That is the sort of exemption we are talking about .
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification .
This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination .
For instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian .
Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .
It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .
In other words , it is positive discrimination .
In the example which you mentioned , it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic .
That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable .
Question No 41 by ( H-0813 / 99 ) :
Does the Commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women , or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies ?
Obviously , the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the Structural Funds , the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund exist for the cohesion policy .
I should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget .
I should point out that 70 % of funding for the period 2000-2006 , i.e. EUR 195 billion , will go to the less-favoured regions of Europe .
Commissioner , thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer , which has been rigorous and well-argued .
However , I can assure you that we do not , with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less-favoured regions .
They are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .
I am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to .
I can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .
I would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies .
The Commissioner accepts and takes good note of Mrs Izquierdo Rojo ' s intervention .
Question No 42 by ( H-0817 / 99 ) :
Can the Commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme ?
We estimate that the Commission ' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer .
In order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultations with Parliament , the social partners and non-governmental organisations .
These discussions have already started , but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon .
The Lisbon European Council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reforms .
These results will be most important in shaping the Commission ' s social programme .
Clearly , any future social action programme should take account of developments , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .
We need to see which concrete alternatives the Commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements .
Firstly , I agree with you entirely . Account will be taken of the information society ; that was something which I too mentioned .
Social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .
Secondly , there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented .
Since the author is not present , Question No 43 lapses .
Question No 44 by ( H-0819 / 99 ) :
However , for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement is still highly restricted .
What measures is the Commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area ?
On 26 November 1999 , the European Commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination .
As far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned , there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination , especially in the workplace .
The European Commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these persons .
Of course , it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport , services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement .
The European Commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses , coaches and other vehicles , so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them .
I would thank the Commissioner for her answer .
My question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in Europe .
I am grateful for the fact that the Commission has adopted an action plan .
It is of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability .
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport , so that people with special needs can use them .
It has not yet been passed by the Council ; it is at the consultation stage .
I think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at European level .
I think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport .
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education , for young people , for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy .
Question No 45 by ( H-0006 / 00 ) :
Subject : Compliance with Directive 96 / 71 / EC concerning the posting of workers The posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in Denmark , even though the deadline has passed .
The draft legislation before the Folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements .
However , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .
There are therefore two possible solutions : either the Directive is inapplicable in Denmark , or Denmark is required by the Directive to introduce universally applicable agreements .
If not , will it explain how the Directive is to be complied with in this area ?
What it says it that one of two things may apply , i.e. either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector .
In other words , to put it simply , Denmark has a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it .
Discussions are being held between the European Commission and Denmark , and Denmark is expected to notify the Commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation .
The deadline by which it had to answer the Commission ' s questions expired on 6 December 1999 and we have not received a reply .
We are waiting to see what the next move will be .
Firstly , no attempt is being made to change the system in Denmark or in any other country .
As far as your question is concerned , this problem does not only apply to Denmark .
It is not only Denmark which has matters pending .
Five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage .
And this is the direction in which we expect the Danish and the other nine governments to move .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for your dedication .
You have fulfilled your objective for today , which is to answer all the questions .
We congratulate you .
Since the time allocated to Questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes Question Time .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
1997 discharge
The Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , is not here yet , but I hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minutes .
Mr President , I am sure that Mrs Schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise .
I would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation .
Mr President , early last year , the 1997 discharge was postponed because this Parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning Commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future .
In its resolution , this Parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious , far-reaching proposals for reform from the new European Commission .
This report , therefore , appears at a crucial time , on the eve of Mr Kinnock ' s reforms .
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans .
In the period leading up to this , it already appeared , on the basis of the initial drafts , that the Commission had made very important pledges .
We asked for a whistle-blower ' s regulation , and this is now in place .
Parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated .
This has now been done .
Parliament requires a code of conduct for Commissioners and Cabinets .
This is in place too .
Parliament asked the Commission to waive its excessive privileges .
It did this as well .
The Commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with Parliament in terms of SEM 2000 .
Fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices .
These are sound , first steps which illustrate that , if this Parliament so wishes , changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly .
We want more than that , however .
The Commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme .
This is not only necessary for proper public administration , it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the European citizen .
We now demand from the European Commission clear pledges concerning the following points .
Firstly , Parliament must have complete access to all Commission documents .
This , however , presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents .
In the context of providing information , I would like to draw the Commission ' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents .
If the current draft is correct , then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today .
We must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in Brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not .
Neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents .
We would also like a clear job description for each European official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful .
Ultimately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts .
This Parliament has also asked the Commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 March of this year .
It is unacceptable that the Commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , as yet , it has been left unused .
Mr President , since 1996 , the discharge has acquired a heavy , political significance .
It is one of the most powerful weapons Parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care .
This is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .
However , we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place .
Indeed , the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the Court of Auditors have been cleared up .
Finally , this discharge report is naturally addressed to the Commission .
But this does not detract from the fact that the European Parliament should also put its own house in order .
As long as we have no status , we are not credible as a force for reforming the Union .
The reforms of the European institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue Europe ' s development process .
We cannot have a decisive and fair Europe unless it is also open and democratic .
All institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of Europe .
During the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget .
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .
I know that all the Institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the Commission and for some of the lack of resources . That cannot excuse everything that we came across .
Citizens of Europe expect the European institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so .
That is why I want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of Europe by Mr Prodi and Mr Kinnock .
From what I have seen of the reform process , it looks good .
I saw some of Mr Kinnock 's papers today , I heard some of what he had to say .
I have every confidence that if we and the politicians of Europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .
But we need that reform process .
Many of the general points raised in our committee 's report have been covered in Mrs van der Laan 's report .
It is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .
It seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details .
It groups them together and that is very important .
There are two issues I would like to draw your attention to .
One is nuclear safety in Eastern Europe .
We have to get this right .
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly .
We have to remedy that .
The second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .
We need from the Commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending .
I hope colleagues in this House will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the Commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue .
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .
Mr President , Commissioner , if we are honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation .
We are discussing last year ' s discharge , but also the Commission ' s responsibility .
I would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks .
The assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed .
It is about a Commission which is no more .
There is now a new Commission .
Then it is logical to grant discharge , because how can the current Commissioner be blamed where 1997 is concerned ?
The problems remain and this gives rise to doubts .
We have to take a decision now regarding the Commission ' s good intentions , but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions .
Mr Kinnock will present his proposal next month .
We are all very much anticipating this , but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge .
It is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled .
This dilemma stretches beyond the areas which I have already listed . Take , for example , the pledges made by the Commission .
They look good in themselves . I have read a few documents written by Mr Kinnock and we have every confidence in them .
But I will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the Commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of documents .
The previous speaker already said something about this .
A document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the Commission - which , instead of enhancing the public nature of documents , is having the opposite effect .
This is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results . This also applies to whistle-blowers .
We have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .
So there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the Commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made .
This also applies , for example , to the very real projects which the Committee on Industry has introduced .
Clear progress must be visible .
At present , we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals , but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so .
Finally , Mr President , the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last Commission .
In assessing the question of whether or not to grant the Commission discharge , the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned , in this case in the course of 1997 .
In our Group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .
In that year , we voted against granting discharge . As a result , we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997 , too .
We think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the Court of Auditors .
It is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised .
So far , the promises which have been made are still , however , to be fulfilled , especially where transparency is concerned .
We are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution , but against the granting of discharge .
Mr President , first of all , I have only positive comments to make on Mrs Van der Laan ' s very expert work on this report .
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997 .
The report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts .
We support these critical remarks , and I must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approving the accounts .
Again , I must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old Commission ' s accountability for 1997 and the new Commission ' s accountability for the future .
We do not think that the new Commission , under any circumstances , could incur liability for the past .
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission ' s liability as an institution .
The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better .
By means of this extraordinary procedure , Parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 squarely where it belongs , namely with the previous Commission .
It was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous Commission , and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating .
There is no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .
That is just the way things are , however .
In taking over the mandate , the new Commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made .
This question ought to have been asked when the new Commission was appointed .
If Parliament votes in favour of the Committee on Budgetary Control ' s proposal this week and grants discharge , then the Commission must not take this to be a blank cheque .
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan ' s report that is the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution .
The comments contained within , under eight headings , are an integral part of the discharge , the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision .
We will be in a position to judge just as soon as the Commission presents its reform programme .
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority .
Mr President , we all recall that Parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new European Commission regarding internal reform .
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures .
It is fair to say that the new President , Mr Prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament .
Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .
Mr President , the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it does not deserve it .
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and , therefore , the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability .
It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission ' s remit .
The new Commission has , on the other hand , undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals , and I must admit that I am not impressed at all .
The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one ' s friends unfortunately still exists .
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start .
I do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly .
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO .
I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter .
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control , and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information .
From the outside , it looks as if the Commission has something to hide .
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .
The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission .
It was this practice which led to the Commission ' s downfall .
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents .
Otherwise , we cannot carry out our work .
Thank you , Commissioner Schreyer .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts
Mr President , this time last year the European Parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by Mr Middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the European Commission .
On 15 March the committee published its first report concluding that : " It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility " .
Within a few hours of the presentation of the report President Santer announced the resignation of his entire team .
The resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident Parliament and a European Commission mired in allegations of scandal .
Since then the Brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition ; a new , reinvigorated Parliament has been elected and a new Commission confirmed in office .
The new Commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function .
A code of conduct for Commissioners and their private offices has been adopted .
In a symbolic but significant gesture Commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , petrol and consumer goods .
New rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials .
The number of departments has been reduced .
The Commission , in my opinion , has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated .
In order to achieve this , action is required in four areas .
First , financial management and control within the Commission must be improved .
One of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control .
The Commission 's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control .
A new independent audit system service must be set up .
DGs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities .
In return for this greater degree of autonomy , managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions .
It is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .
Changes to the Financial Regulation will be required and Parliament must have its say on those changes .
But while the Commission must ensure that it respects the Treaty and the Financial Regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be an excuse for inertia .
Urgent change is required today .
Second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened , firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive .
This requires a clear example to be set by Commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly , by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud .
A proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of Article 280 of the Treaty , by the middle of this year .
Third , standards in European public life must be upheld .
The political crisis which led to the downfall of the Commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct .
A number of codes have since been introduced .
They must be assessed by Parliament and should be made legally binding .
Whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected .
At the end of last year Mr Kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers . They must be implemented without delay .
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management , they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong .
Crucially , reforms must not be limited to the Commission .
Parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules , administrative procedures and management practices .
Finally , the Commission 's human resource policy must be modernised . It is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern , multinational organisation .
The social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue .
A career with the European institutions must become more attractive .
Too many young , new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years .
Merit must be recognised and rewarded , specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade .
The promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent .
Last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed .
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions .
Commissioner Kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .
This communication must contain a clear timetable .
With a new Commission and a new Parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be .
Enlargement of the Union is just a few years away .
Now is the time for Europe to put its own house in order ; to instil in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility .
In June of last year Europe 's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism .
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories . Let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism .
All the experts can provide information and news , formulate opinions and give advice , but , they have no political or elective responsibility , and rightly so .
It is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the European Parliament or its committees any documentation .
Members of Parliament must possess the qualities of morality , discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately , and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else .
I would point out that there is no European legal system , but that a different legal system exists in each Member State .
We run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways .
I am opposed to European Community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat : whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium .
In conclusion , Mr President , Parliament must introduce a principle of democracy : we must implement reforms which allow Parliament to grow and expand its powers , not go into reverse .
This debate on the van Hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the European institutions since their creation in 1957 .
Those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the Commission operated .
Remember that the Council of Ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the Commission itself resigned on 15 March .
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September .
Our greatest concern in the EPP is to ensure that public confidence in the European Commission is restored .
Further steps to build a strong Europe will be to no avail if the European peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials .
Under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency .
We are therefore concerned to see the flurry of Commission announcements in recent weeks by Commissioner Kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a White Paper shortly .
While conveying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the Commission is in transmission rather than listening mode .
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information .
This was , after all , one of the causes of the downfall of the last Commission .
Have the lessons not been learnt ?
We could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be demeaning for Parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the Commission to take up in its reform package .
The less precise , Mr van Hulten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to do what they like .
We believe the vast number of recommendations of the Wise Men ' s report should be implemented .
Looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission .
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals .
Commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred .
In a nutshell : there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available .
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions .
But , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination .
Mr President , I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation .
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report .
It is an excellent report .
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues .
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced .
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse .
Yes , a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet , and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow .
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far .
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission .
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation .
That is important .
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another .
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible .
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal .
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission .
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service .
I will give you one example of this . In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million .
It is clear that is not acceptable .
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation ?
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit .
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working .
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated .
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones .
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history .
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .
Our own staff policy is outdated . Some of our working practices need radical reform .
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process .
Finally , can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public .
European taxpayers need to be re-assured .
The fate of the Commission , of the whole European Union , rests on delivery of this reform .
That is the key issue , delivery of these proposals .
Mr President , I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur , Mr van Hulten , on his first report .
I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments .
We have submitted an amendment to this effect .
From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report , I would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly .
Firstly , I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents .
The Commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired .
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair , which , as it happens , has still not been sorted out .
Curiously , very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets , even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General , and this is clearly something which should not happen .
If Parliament want to carry out proper inspections , these documents must be available , and I would like to know what the Commission intends to do to improve this situation .
I would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control .
This has also been partly dealt with in the van Hulten report .
I think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented .
The general impression at present is that anything budget-related within Europe is bad .
It is clear that , over the past couple of years , we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure .
Is this possible ?
I would like to suggest to the Commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out .
If we admit new Member States then we need to put our own House in order first .
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten .
It is his first report here in plenary .
This is worth a compliment although I regret , of course , that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue .
It is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late .
In my opinion , this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our Committee on Budgetary Control .
Let us be honest .
The second report of the Wise Men arrived in September .
We are now four months down the line .
Meanwhile , Mr van Hulten has been inundated with amendments , more than 100 amendments in the first round .
He went back to work , rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions , but had to face nearly another 100 amendments in the second round .
My fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed , too extensive and too late .
Might Mr Kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?
Mr van Hulten , my Group of the Greens and regionalists will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon ' s plenary meeting to embellish this report .
After all , it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report .
So tomorrow , if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs , this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable .
In any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully backs the recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men .
In any event , I look forward to the document which was approved by the Commission today .
I also look forward to the White Paper which will be available in February .
I would like to end on the following point .
I think that there is a need for this , as public opinion is looking for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002 .
Mr President , this report is positive but , actually , we need more than this .
Fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere . They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow .
Via the structural funds , a great deal of the European budget is being pumped around the system .
This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States .
But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States .
Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating .
After each incident of improper use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for stricter control is more pronounced .
Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem . It will , at best , lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects .
It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour .
This is probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less overheads , more transparency and more democracy .
Mr President , a year has not yet passed , but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently .
Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee , thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state .
I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time , which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates , discussions and the exchange of information .
Mr President , when it comes to putting its own house in order , the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation .
There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission .
I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound , the more applause they receive .
This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue .
Nevertheless , the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see , and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report .
Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points .
Allow me to start with the most important demand .
We do not want financial control to be abolished .
The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made , not in every case , but wherever uncertainties or risks arise .
The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here , by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits , for example .
It may well be easy enough to change the Commission ' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts , particularly those relating to budgetary discipline .
This cannot be ignored or evaded , certainly not on account of soft law , as was once suggested at a meeting of our Committee .
It is to be welcomed that Mr van Hulten ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie , which must be tackled .
A few salient points : the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect , especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours , including those of a financial nature .
There is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned , and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the Commission are rather vague .
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked .
Mr President , firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague , Mr van Hulten .
It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am , I think , entitled to feel a little proud of him .
I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .
Mr President , the Commission ' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy .
The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one .
A lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending .
It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organised on that basis .
When the Commission ' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March , I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change .
This is the best support we can give to European democracy .
If , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century , we are witnessing a very special moment indeed .
Mr President , first of all , congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report .
It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time .
Mr van Hulten , I think you deserve a medal for your efforts .
There are two points which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR .
Firstly , there is the Commissioners ' individual responsibility .
This must be regulated during the IGC .
Secondly , as already mentioned by my colleague , Mr Mulder , the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts .
This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution .
We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well .
Only when all European institutions are reformed will we have the open , democratic and decisive Europe which our citizens now finally deserve .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate Mr van Hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the House .
I am sure that it will serve , amongst other things , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups .
At this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reforming the Commission , demanded by our citizens .
This Parliament has often heard the desire to reform the Commission expressed , even by its Presidents .
It now appears that this desire is more serious .
This Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme .
The report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the Committee of Experts commissioned by this Parliament .
Mr Prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .
We therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it is , I can assure him that he will have the support of this House in the reform process .
We want a strong Commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .
Commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office .
Therefore , the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties .
Perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise .
I do not know your exact view in this respect , Mr Kinnock , but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed .
We want a structure which allows every Euro to be spent effectively , and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present .
Mr President , the Santer Commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line .
Therefore , the future of this new Commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order .
Naturally , this is only to be welcomed .
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price , as it were , that is , of having to dispense with independent - and I stress , independent - prior approval .
Up until now , the Commission ' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa .
And so it is the " two key " principle that applies here .
A single key is to suffice in future .
The financial controller is no longer to make advance checks , if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the Commission .
If you will pardon me for saying so , Mr Kinnock , what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes .
What we really need to focus on , however , is making the checks more effective .
This could be achieved by no longer insisting , in future , that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp .
It is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all .
Therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that is , only in cases of uncertainty or risk .
However , the financial controllers must work independently .
That is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the Commission , when it talks in terms of decentralisation .
It is obviously the Commission ' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual Directorates-General , but this is precisely what we do not want .
Surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the Leonardo affair , when the internal examiners in the relevant Directorate-General issued warnings , but these were neither heeded nor passed on .
Therefore , independence is prerequisite for effective checks .
That is the position which a clear majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control subscribes to .
Indeed , the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ?
I believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow ' s vote .
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard .
Mr President , a couple of years ago , the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures .
This led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions , whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise .
This was stupid of the old Commission , and Parliament was of no help on that occasion .
When I read Mr van Hulten ' s passage about personnel policy , I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air .
There are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .
There is no backbone , and no teeth .
Where is the beef ?
And I would also say this to you , Commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it is British .
Romano Prodi promised a revolution .
You have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself , but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues , the ones where it hurts !
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances .
Stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it says here in the report , but as a management tool .
Ensure too , that training becomes a management tool .
Do not listen to the report ' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed .
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis .
We have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing .
Mr President , I want to thank Mr van Hulten for his report and to say that I voted for it .
So I refer to the things I do not agree with .
I do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to Parliament .
This report is about the Commission .
Parliament is a separate subject .
There is no need for us to bring Parliament into the discussion on the Commission .
In addition to that , there is the question of duty-free .
That was a stick used to beat the Commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the Commission abolished duty-free in airports .
It is not worthy of being brought into this report either .
Most of the report is about financial control . That is reasonable because it comes from the Budgetary Control Committee .
But we should not create the impression that vast amounts of European resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the European Commission .
After all , it is only 1 % of GDP , by comparison with national spending .
So carelessness within the Commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money .
We should get it into perspective . It is important to remember that .
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money . They have very little of it .
I am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .
If there is , we have generated it in this House in the past year .
I have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
That is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were .
This Commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the Commission that went before it .
While there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .
Mr President , I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .
I hope that the Commission will use it in its reform work .
The process of reform has been going on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission .
The Commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well .
Naturally , there are good , capable employees in the Commission , and they are in the majority .
But we need radical reform .
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .
People should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable .
The Financial Regulation should be amended .
We agree that we should have better control of the finances .
It is just a question of how .
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control .
We should be careful about this . We should retain some form of ex ante financial control .
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent .
This would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through .
Instead , we should be reforming and decentralising control .
The Commission does not have enough staff .
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs .
The staffing system is too rigid .
There should be a more frequent rotation of employees , especially at the top of the hierarchy .
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees .
I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed .
After all , the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms .
I hope , like so many others , that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved .
We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to rush again to put out the next one .
As Mr Blak said , we must instead establish a system with clear roles .
First of all , we need tough regulations , which can be implemented .
Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough . There need to be tough rules stating , among other things , what may be decentralised , what may be outsourced and what is independent .
What we need , then , are basic administrative regulations for the EU , for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States .
These are what are missing .
We have asked for a Public Prosecutor ' s Office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the EU .
We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt , as binding regulations , the ombudsman ' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .
Secondly , we must also clarify our own auditing roles .
The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations , but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action .
It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation .
We do not hunt down criminals . That is OLAF ' s job .
Tell me what national parliament , for example , is handed all preliminary investigation documents .
Mr President , I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .
I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch , now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so .
Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .
I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement , also with its amendments .
I think that this is also the case here , but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments .
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz , who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective .
Mr President , one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is , to my mind , the rapporteur ' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration .
A very important proposal indeed .
I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan , because she wants to scrap it altogether .
I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .
I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock , but I happen to know Mr Kinnock .
He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary .
In my opinion , such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary .
Finally , the issue of officials .
Actually , I do not entirely share Mr Haarder ' s view .
I do agree that the section on officials has , in fact , been completed totally inadequately .
First of all , the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised .
Secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .
For example , we are currently looking into TAOs . This is a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the Commission .
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other , and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table .
Mr President , ever since Plato ' s ' Republic ' , the Western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts .
This lesson in wisdom is 100 % ideology and 0 % knowledge .
This will not help us to reform the European institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions .
The van Hulten report started out as a brilliant one and I would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what Mr van Hulten achieved .
Unfortunately , it was then changed , and changed for the worse , which turned it into a document which in fact , proposes something that we cannot accept .
Mr President , Mr van Hulten , your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising , arduous and complex , and I believe this is important in a first report .
Please therefore accept what I am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate , and I believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer .
This report seems to me to be redundant , long-winded , confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used .
Perhaps ' redundant ' is the most serious epithet , and you are not responsible for this . It is the responsibility of this Parliament .
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission , we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them .
Meanwhile , we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence .
' Long-winded ' .
I am not going to mention the length of this report .
I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly does .
It is also ' confusing ' .
I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament .
That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .
And finally , Mr President , frankly , I am not going to give examples , but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy .
Therefore - in summary - I await , and many of us await , your report , Commissioner Kinnock , so that we can really express our opinion on it , which is the duty of this Parliament .
Mr President , the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are .
When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them .
Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
The concept of transparency stands out in the report .
Securing this is a major priority .
The importance of smooth-running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough .
This is not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it is about showing good will towards the citizens .
We must win back their faith in EU politics .
The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them .
This is what enables them to understand what is going on . They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served
Whether or not the reforms succeed depends , to a very large extent , on the Commission ' s own initiative .
However , it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis .
I believe , Mr Kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level , the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations .
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House .
Mr President , may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and , from what I hear , the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report .
I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative .
Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary .
I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that .
There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile .
The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance .
I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode .
Hence the transmission .
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations .
The need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does .
This is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this House , but more generally to the European public .
Naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible .
I have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a Commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning .
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission .
Financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform .
Several Members have made that point again in the course of today 's debate .
We share the view , forcefully expressed by the Committee of Independent Experts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures .
The means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the Commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the Financial Regulation in April .
Parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .
I share the view expressed by Mrs Theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law .
Change in the law is fundamental .
That service will open on 1 May this year .
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation .
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague , Mrs Schreyer , who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening .
As Budgets Commissioner , here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors .
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits .
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them .
The proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes .
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called " a big bang approach " .
Financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate .
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts .
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .
In addition , I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997 .
" The Commission 's internal control " he said " is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation .
For instance , the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered .
At the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies , notably the same Financial Controller , the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General . "
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this .
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition .
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document .
Our objective , the committee ' s objective , the Court of Auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control , it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control .
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing .
Since June of last year , the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities .
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line .
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed .
We are seeking to implement best practice .
As a corollary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations .
A communication later this year will give full details .
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism .
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament .
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change .
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House .
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework .
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life .
That is in line with the draft resolution .
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions .
I welcome Parliament 's support for that .
We are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of Mr van Hulten 's report .
The draft resolution rightly recalls the Commission 's accountability to this Parliament .
President Prodi and Vice-President de Palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the Commission 's practical commitment to that .
I hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents .
The point was very properly raised by Mr Elles and referred to by Mrs Thors .
I am sure they are aware that in mid-December we officially received the draft framework agreement with Parliament .
We are now waiting for Parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text .
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .
The report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .
I also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions .
It certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .
While the reform strategy White Paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential .
A series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months . Each of them will be available for reflection and response by this House .
It is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with Parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations .
The early thoughts of Parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .
I conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the House relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change .
That is most certainly relevant .
We are sure that there will be an important " reform dividend " as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources .
It is very clear , however , that parts of the Commission services are already very stretched .
Parliament has frequently made that point .
Secondly , it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology .
Thirdly , it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken .
They are already having implications for resource availability .
A central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management .
The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of Mr van Hulten 's report .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m. )
Middle East peace process ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East peace process .
Such is life .
I hope that honourable Members will excuse me if I am not able to stay to the end of the debate as I would , in all normal circumstances , wish to do .
The debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis I had arranged to see visitors from the Balkans this evening .
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion .
It is not something , I assure you , which I would wish to make a practice of .
There is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future .
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track .
The situation of the Palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .
A fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the Middle East .
Israelis and Palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum .
Although there has been some slippage , I trust that the remaining Israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon .
I was reassured that this was also the view of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat , when they met on Monday .
Honourable Members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track .
This is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close liaison with the US and Russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties .
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .
The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month .
I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again .
The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process , as all sides - Palestinians , Israelis , their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged .
Nor is our role confined to that of banker .
We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .
But we should not kid ourselves : a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag .
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments .
We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon .
But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process .
We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians .
We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan , Lebanon , Syria and Egypt .
With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them .
European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period .
In this context , let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency .
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week .
This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts .
The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs .
We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year .
This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels .
Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East .
Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy .
Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon , the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable efforts .
We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole .
A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world , numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead .
We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region 's very scarce water resources .
It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace .
I want to underline that point .
I wish insistently to remind the Council and , should it be necessary , Parliament , that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing .
I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide .
I hope I can add that we will want to provide that .
We have made progress in recent months and weeks , as Mr Gama mentioned earlier .
But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way .
We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome .
I hope the House will understand that .
Mr President , Commissioner Patten has our understanding .
I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and , therefore , I hope to see him there soon .
The tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation .
I honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .
In this sense , I share Commissioner Patten ' s positive attitude .
Let me explain : it is true that the Israeli Government has delayed the third hand-over of West Bank territory to the Palestinian authorities .
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks , as Prime Minister Barak has promised .
I would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences , which are still no doubt profound , between the parties .
It is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist .
There is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the President of the European Parliament to the region will contribute to this .
Mr President , I want to thank Commissioner Patten for his detailed account .
I should like to say that I agree with the tone which Galeote Quecedo ' s speech set here . We in Parliament strongly support the Middle East peace process .
It is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .
If we think of how the process was looking a year ago , the difference between then and now is like that between night and day , despite difficulties and delays .
This applies both to the interim agreement and to the Hebron and Wye Agreements . While the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun , I think it is important to keep the two processes apart .
A lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements .
The second point relates to Syria . There , the border question is obviously central .
How negotiations are proceeding there , we still do not know .
What is important , however , is that they have begun .
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water .
As things are at present , the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel 's water supply .
The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon .
According to UNIFIL , there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw , which is something we welcome .
There too , of course , outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees .
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State .
This may be proclaimed in the course of this year , with or without Israel ' s support .
The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party .
Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year , there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date .
This is something to which we all want to contribute .
Mr President , I would like to refer , firstly and above all , to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate .
The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East .
It is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .
Indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .
Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders , as well as Syria ' s integrity .
It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue .
Nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the European Union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .
This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union ' s common foreign and security policy .
This is where Mr Solana , the High Representative to the Council , could come into his own .
The Commission and Member States also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region .
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .
In this respect , we support Libya ' s participation , provided that it recognises human rights , renounces support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process .
There are still , needless to say , many unresolved problems and unanswered questions , also involving the Palestinians .
Mr President , it is pleasing that , despite certain delays and problems , the peace negotiations are going on both between Israel and Palestine and between Israel and Syria .
The moment of truth is approaching .
Is Israel prepared to comply with the UN ' s resolutions and , in exchange for peace and security , hand back the Arab areas which were conquered in 1967 ?
Will Israel let Palestinian refugees return or be given compensation ?
Will Israel share Jerusalem and the water of the River Jordan ?
Will a free Palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?
Will Syria fully accept Israel ' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ?
The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country , Israel , does not prevent the Arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility .
Peace in the Middle East concerns us all , however .
It is therefore good that the EU should act as a godparent to the Palestinian state .
Against this background , I want to conclude with a remarkable story from Sweden where an international Intergovernmental Conference on Hitler ' s extermination of the Jews is being held , which is obviously a welcome initiative .
Of 47 states invited from all corners of the world , not one of them , however , is an Arab state included in the EU ' s Barcelona process .
This has been interpreted as indicating that the Arab attitude towards Israel should be regarded by Europeans as being similar to the Nazis ' anti-Semitism , which of course is completely incorrect .
The Arab world ' s criticism of Israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti-colonialism as , for example , Algeria ' s fight for freedom against France .
But today , Egypt , Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel .
I therefore wonder whether Commissioner Patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one Arab state to the holocaust conference in Stockholm .
I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question , but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982 .
However , Israel is not the only country concerned with security .
Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999 , 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated , 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak ' s Government .
Trees have been uprooted , houses are still being demolished and , above all , water supplies have been reduced or refused , especially in East Jerusalem , while the settlements continue and are growing constantly .
Nevertheless , there is no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive steps have been taken : negotiations , at least , have resumed .
But in the Middle East , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state , if they cannot move freely within their own territory .
All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332 , 248 , 245 and 194 .
We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria , as well as Mr Barak ' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el ­ -Sheikh agreements .
We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid .
We cannot be content with a role backstage . We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States , as Minister Gama said .
I was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria had been suspended .
I very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date .
Nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the Middle East of late .
Political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the Middle East .
I know that if agreement can be reached between Syria and Israel , the Israeli Prime Minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with Syria in any future referendum .
The settlers at the Golan Heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security .
If Syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the Israel / Syria question might be promising .
On the issue of Palestine , I recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the Wye Agreement .
The key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment , as well as the transfer of territories .
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted , as well as not approving new ones , pose further obstacles .
These issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , I believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely .
Currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed .
Mr President , the various motions for resolutions tabled in Parliament more or less represent the situation in the Middle East .
There are those who are in favour of new agreements between Israel and Syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the Middle East issue .
Indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .
Mr President , the Israeli author , Amos Oz , managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the Israelis and Syrians recently .
He was under the impression that the Syrians thought that , in exchange for the Golan Heights , all they had to do was to fax the Israelis a receipt .
Oz ' s impression is also echoed in the Israeli press .
It contrasts Prime Minister Barak ' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of Damascus , President Assad , at the negotiations in the United States .
Surely Assad would be Barak ' s ideal negotiating partner and not the Foreign Affairs Minister .
And the Israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of Minister Farouk al-Shara in Shepherdstown .
His behaviour towards Prime Minister Ehud Barak was plainly insulting .
But why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ?
Well , the Syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .
At the end of the day , Israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the Golan .
All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process .
I would like to finish off by asking the European Council and Commission a question . How accurate are the press reports which state that the Portuguese Presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the Golan ?
The suspension of the talks between Syria and Israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the Middle East .
The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authorities and Israel is also suspended at the moment .
What can the European Union do in these circumstances ?
Unfortunately , very little .
When we consider that a conference will soon be held in Moscow , it becomes clear that the European Union ' s presence in this peace process is somewhat pitiful .
I would like to insist to the Portuguese Presidency that we must play a greater role , that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the European Union in this process .
First , I believe that we can welcome the agreement between Israel and the Palestinian authorities .
But we have enough agreements now : Oslo , Wye Plantation , Sharm el-Sheikh .
We have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented .
However , in this regard I share Mr Salafranca ' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from Israel this week , namely that the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe .
My second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel .
I consider this to be very encouraging news .
But we have also learned this week that Mr Barak will not be travelling to Washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued .
I should like to make it quite clear : if the Golan Heights are returned to Syria , the problem in this region will be solved .
On the question of the referendum which various Members have referred to : we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations .
That would be a similar situation .
My third and last point concerns the role of the European Union .
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos ' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there , Commissioner Patten .
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it .
Then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution .
This hope is contained in our motion for a resolution . We hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders .
All the foreign troops , including therefore the Syrian forces , must withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 520 of the United Nations Security Council .
Dare we hope for an Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon by July 2000 , the date promised by Ehud Barak ?
Dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between Israel and its neighbours to the north ?
We really hope and believe so .
Never have the parties been so determined .
One fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from Europe and which must exist between the people . There must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations .
Following the attack in Hadera on Monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .
In terms of balance , or should I say imbalance , I must add that it is to be regretted that Europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict .
At midday , Mr Gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by Europe to the region .
Despite everything , we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of Washington .
Like other Arab countries before them , the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations .
This was the choice also made by Israel where Europe suffers from a partisan public image , and this is a fact , not a judgement .
Although it is difficult for Europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity .
Area of Freedom , Security and Justice
Mr President , 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , of the communitisation of the Schengen Agreement and of the Extraordinary Tampere Council .
These have been the most important moments in the Council ' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .
It has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation .
This has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a Community framework .
They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner , Mr Antonio Vitorino , and we congratulate them on this as well .
It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to , the other begrudges .
Despite all the commitments made at the highest level , the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged .
Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this Parliament is unable to do so .
We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them .
We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament .
I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out .
There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework .
Schengen has been incorporated , as we said earlier , into the acquis , but it has been done with very little transparency .
The same is true with regard to immigration policy .
We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports , but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives ; they have disappeared .
We hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations .
We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament .
The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union .
The Council can act in accordance with Parliament ' s decisions , or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project .
If it chooses the second approach , it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice is built .
Alternatively , it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions , in order to move forward in another way .
Fulfil your obligations to Parliament in a generous spirit , thus preparing for the future .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is rather moving for me to return to this House in my capacity as a Member of the Council .
So it is with some pride and satisfaction that I find myself here and able to meet up again with some of my colleagues from those days who are still in this House .
We gave an early signal when , before the start of the Portuguese Presidency , we met with the President and Vice-Presidents of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs in Brussels .
( Applause )
and whenever the committee thinks fit , and the Chairman requests it , I myself or my colleague , the Minister for Justice , will come to Brussels to take part in the work of the meeting .
Furthermore , I would like to say that the Council believes that 1999 was an important year in the field of justice and home affairs .
Cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs was notable for the significant changes wrought by the Treaty of Amsterdam and , as a consequence , for the incorporation of Schengen into the Community framework .
The German Presidency had an important task in this respect in achieving the transition from the Maastricht system to the Amsterdam system .
Then there was the launching of Europol soon after the start of the Finnish Presidency , on 1 July 1999 .
There was also a third notable event : the Tampere Summit , a European Council devoted exclusively to justice and home affairs .
The point that the Portuguese Presidency wishes to reiterate here is that we intend to keep issues connected with the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of the presidency ' s political agenda .
The Secretary-General of the Council has published a collection of documents covering the entire Schengen acquis , pending publication in the Official Journal once all the translations are available .
This collection is , at present , available in six languages and the remaining translations are nearing completion .
Another issue I wish to raise concerns programmes in the field of immigration and asylum and how they apply to the CEECs .
In March 1998 , the Council adopted the Odysseus programme , a programme of training , exchanges and cooperation in the fields of policy on asylum , immigration and crossing of external borders .
It applies to the fifteen Member States of the Union and provides for applicant countries , and possibly third countries also , to be associated with it .
This programme covers the period 1998 to 2002 , and the reference amount for its implementation is EUR 12 million .
Applicant countries can be associated with projects selected by the management committee as long as this complies with the objectives of the programme .
The financial envelope envisaged for 2000 is EUR 3 million .
Under the 1999 programme , the Commission received 80 applications for finance , totalling EUR 7.5 million , against a budget for 1999 of EUR 3 million .
The Commission proposed support for 35 projects , of which 12 were for EUR 50 000 and 23 for amounts over EUR 50 000 .
With regard to the OISIN programme , and I am now referring to the 1997 budget year , projects were adopted for seminars , training , exchanges of officials , research and studies , and operational actions .
Of 62 projects in all , seven included applicant countries .
As regards SIS , the Schengen Information System , I am pleased to report that the Member States were very positive about its operation and use .
The increase in the number of positive results demonstrates the efficiency of the system and there is a continuing increase in the number of reports .
Mrs Terrón i Cusí also mentioned an interinstitutional agreement .
( Sustained applause )
And I must not forget the Finnish Presidency ' s proposal for a Council decision which is being considered in the Multi-disciplinary Group .
Our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime .
Another area is EU involvement in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its various protocols , and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the Council of Europe , in particular on cyber crime .
Still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro , and the European Parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance .
The French Presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of Europol .
For this reason , it is essential that the Council ' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel , so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also .
We are familiar with Parliament ' s views and we know that Parliament is aware of the views of the Council ' s legal advisers .
In this first speech , I would like to share with Parliament the Commission ' s view of the most important events in 1999 .
I believe that I can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the Union on issues of freedom , security and justice .
This project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common Union .
The Union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom , security and justice was confirmed at Tampere .
1999 was also marked by the German Presidency ' s initiative to draw up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
In addition to these events , I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999 .
The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration , and ultimately , in December , it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund .
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment .
In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime , the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering .
In 1999 , the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs , which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council .
In the coming weeks , I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs .
I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project .
And we hope , during the Portuguese Presidency , to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council , taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned .
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions , and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny .
I also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims , alimony claims and non-contested claims .
As a follow-up to the Tampere and Helsinki conclusions , the Commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a European Union strategy to combat organised crime .
We will be organising and supporting actions including , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters .
The Commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross-pillar issue .
We are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime .
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004 .
In this field the Commission , in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament , will give its full support to the Interinstitutional Conference to be held on drugs in February .
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty .
Lastly , I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I hope that the Commission and the Council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself .
As I have told Parliament , the task before us is immense and ambitious , and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge .
Minister Gomes , I have , of course , heard what you have said and I hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the Portuguese Presidency .
I should like to raise three points which for us , as Members of the PPE Group , must be focal points when such an area is created .
First : a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed .
The Council must start by at long last ensuring that EURODAC is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers .
As far as a European asylum law is concerned , a start was in fact made at Vienna and Tampere .
Unfortunately , however , it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions .
I therefore call on the Council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole Union .
Similarly , it cannot be right for just a few Member States willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent .
Agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda .
Secondly : the introduction of a Europe-wide fight against organised crime , including by Europol and Eurojust .
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith .
We welcome the fact that Europol has finally been able to start work .
We are not just calling for more control , and more control over Europol ; our motto here is " Less is sometimes more ! "
With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments , we may have a great deal of control , but it is inefficient control .
We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament , without hampering the work of Europol .
At the same time , we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction .
Thirdly : the extension to Parliament ' s rights in this context .
There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and , as we have already said , to strengthen the principle of democratic control .
We want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of Europe , not against them .
Mr President , I have nothing further to say to the Council .
The previous speaker has quoted me from the last committee meeting and said it all !
Why does the Council find it so hard to work with us in creating an area of freedom , security and justice ?
I find this question more and more worrying .
Allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view .
The establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice hovers at the interface between the constituent elements of national sovereignty .
So we have to draw our conclusions and say that we need legal and organisational communitisation of the instruments available .
As a result , the governments which need to do this and which recognise that need , also realise that , in implementing this , they are taking away their own powers .
Then there is the European Parliament , which is also complicated .
It has not quite taken off in the European Parliament and the Council meets behind closed doors .
If the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice is kept secret , then we shall not win the citizens over to it .
In other words , the stability of democracy is at stake if we discuss it .
This is why I frequently get so worked up , but not over the Council of Ministers .
Generally , they too are elected Members of Parliament : Mr Gomes , Mr Costa , Commissioner Vitorino , in principle we are all in the same boat .
However , I should like to make an appeal to the Council apparatchiks .
The following principle applies : He who prepares decisions , in this case the Council apparatchiks , anticipates the decisions , which is why the Council apparatchiks should demonstrate more democratic spirit .
I should just like to mention another aspect briefly because I do not have much time .
Scoreboard sounds like skateboard in German .
I say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulates what must be implemented , when and by whom .
This Vitorino plan is what we need : clear , precise projects with a clear , defined timetable .
Mr Vitorino , whom I would like to thank for his speech , can give us that , provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources .
Let us give him those resources , then he can get on with his job and we all stand to gain .
I warmly welcome the fact that the Portuguese Presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown .
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten ' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises .
Perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in Kosovo the police they promised .
I just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress .
The first is asylum .
It is essential to establish a single European system , but one based on fairness , full respect for the Geneva Convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention .
Decisions on asylum should take months - not years .
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression .
The last area I want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems .
Eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation-state , and so on .
Arrested and released in Madrid , he is now being extradited after arrest in Lisbon .
Whatever the Eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .
Mr President , all I can say about 1999 is this : how wonderful to feel the Portuguese summer after the Finnish winter .
I hope that it works out .
The Tampere Summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for Europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .
Numerous questions are still outstanding .
Answers are still awaited .
Since Tampere , there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent .
Regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding .
On the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life .
The creation of a Charter of Fundamental Rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future .
However , it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the Union .
The Europol agreement has now officially entered into force .
In Tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed .
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .
The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC .
Parliament has amended the contractual text .
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament ' s modus operandi .
Unfortunately , no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them .
Europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors .
And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe .
Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers , I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months .
I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this .
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice .
Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems .
This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres .
For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .
A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extreme-right racist movements .
We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees .
The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable .
All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect .
Last week , and somewhat by chance , I witnessed , at Roissy airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young women , admittedly illegal immigrants , were being returned to Conakry .
They were treated like the worst criminals .
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair , surrounded by a horde of state security police .
The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour .
Our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships .
The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed .
Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up .
The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere , even though this summit provided an important basis .
Likewise , we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action .
The laws against racism must be harmonised .
What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty ?
What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women ?
How do you aim to eradicate homophobia , racism and sexism ?
We must take the best from each of our countries .
In more general terms , this Presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants .
Immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses .
What action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers ?
Mr President , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .
The European Union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees .
The level of racism in our society is terrifying .
Racism in Ireland is endemic .
It has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the European Union for a long time .
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up .
There is a willingness but fear pervades , and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in Ireland but throughout the European Union .
And our current EU mantra is AFSJ : Area for Freedom , Security and Justice .
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House , namely to introduce such an area .
And who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions .
Freedom , security and justice are the root system of any society , reflecting its history , corporate experience and political development .
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result .
But it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security , freedom and justice .
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .
That is already secured by means of the various national legal systems .
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society ' s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU ' s control .
It is concerned with increased integration which , as part of a duplicitous package , involves increased repression and control .
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa , Schengen , Eurodac etc . Any democrat can spot two key problems .
First of all , the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic .
How is it envisaged that the EU ' s institutions , which are already stretched well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition ?
Think of last year ' s deadly criticism of the Commission ' s lack of propriety , ethics and accountability .
It also , of course , finds indirect expression in the question .
But , secondly , the projects will put a strain on , indeed will be injurious to , the national democracies .
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market , only the body was being attacked .
Now , it is the soul .
Mr President , today the people of Northern Ireland see a strange irony .
Let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed .
In 1998 , we had 55 murders .
In 1999 , we had 7 murders and that does not include the Omagh bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured .
Between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people .
Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193 , while those against republicans totalled 97 .
Mr President , that situation cannot continue and needs remedying .
Mr President , the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union .
The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country , Spain , and in Belgium , are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy .
My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum .
We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants .
Finally , in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship .
The Euro , employment , even security , are not enough .
They need a ' European soul ' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said .
Mr President , unlike some of the previous speakers , I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino .
This trio 's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said .
As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated .
Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .
The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months .
The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the European Union .
One area though is extremely important , and this House must be involved in it : namely scrutiny .
And we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries .
I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on .
I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime .
That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about .
But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system , for example .
Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of ' scoreboard ' .
Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is .
A scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible .
I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so .
At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening .
I would like to make three brief points .
The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament .
Let us stop the shadow-boxing .
Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate .
Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process .
Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area .
My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission .
We have established a new Directorate-General , yet it has only 70 people all told .
There is an agreement to double this number , but I understand that , so far , not a single new person has arrived .
We are setting the Commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .
The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs .
Finally , on the content of the debate , I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .
All good things come in threes , especially in our policy area .
Two hundred years ago it was liberty , equality and fraternity , and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others .
Although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice should be mentioned , we must remember that there is still room for progress .
The role of the Court of Justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete .
The unilateral decision by Belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this .
The total lack of progress in European citizenship and the political rights of all European residents is to be regretted .
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future , these plans do nothing to improve human rights , civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned .
We know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements . Yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of ' non-refoulement ' [ no turning back ] .
Furthermore , it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the Council by a procedure without debate and without consulting Parliament .
However , the main concern remains ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner .
I thank them for their statements to the House .
I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States .
We already have , on the international side , plans in place to combat drug trafficking , money laundering and so on .
This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty .
I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December .
Mr President , esteemed gentlemen from Portugal , especially the Council representatives , you face great expectations on our part .
I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment .
I refer to Eurodac .
We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .
We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality .
Even in Tampere , we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality .
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .
My urgent request on behalf of the Group is that you do everything to ensure that Eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures .
If you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .
I refer in particular to the Council and to the inertia of the Member States in implementing the decisions they had jointly made .
From what I have said , it must be obvious to you that the European Parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer .
Do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?
How do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the Community , reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of Europe ?
In light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the UN , is it not about time you abandoned your traditional , conservative views on refugees and immigrants ?
I have great expectations for the Portuguese Presidency .
Mr President , I welcome much , indeed most , of what has been said in this debate .
But I want to add a word of caution .
There are also courts in Karlsruhe , London , Lisbon , Dublin and Edinburgh .
We must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .
We must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security .
We need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these .
But we must look always to subsidiarity .
Like everybody in this House , I want freedom , justice and security .
I do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation , chaos and confusion .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would very quickly like to make one point .
Various Members raised questions about the Portuguese Presidency .
( Sustained applause )
Thank you , Minister .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , I am grateful for the Council ' s oral , and also written , reply .
Their efficiency has been truly remarkable .
I also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .
Representatives of the Council , within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this Parliament .
Question Time ( Council )
The next item is Question Time ( B5-0003 / 2000 ) .
We will examine questions to the Council .
Question No 1 by ( H-0780 / 99 ) :
Mr President , the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety , the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis .
The convention , as you will be aware , also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur .
Thank you for your answer .
However , I would just like to add the following . Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this unit .
Nevertheless , rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons .
In this respect , the issue requires closer examination , because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people ' s suspicions .
Speaking as an engineer , I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances .
However , we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation ; it is just not possible .
With this in mind , it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes .
In this respect , and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union , we should be helping it to become a more secure , peaceful and cooperative country .
That is our role and this is the point of my question .
I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward .
This is , of course , a highly sensitive issue .
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country ' s own pre-accession strategy agenda .
This question will naturally be one of our key concerns , and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account .
Thank you , Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council .
I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog .
However , forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me .
I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately .
Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?
However , I would like to say , Mr Newton Dunn , that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable .
We therefore consider that the General Secretariat of the Council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the Council ' s functions as a legislative body .
I do not consider that the Council tried to answer my question .
I did not ask what the Council thought of the proposal which the Commission has still not tabled .
Instead , my question concerns the interpretation in principle of Article 255 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the European Union referred to there ?
I should like to have an answer to that question .
Does the Council consider that , on the basis of Article 255 of the Treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulated , that is to say legislation not relating to the EU ' s institutions ?
Mr Sjöstedt , the answer that I gave was the only answer possible .
Nevertheless , I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity .
At the moment , there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article , and unless there is such a proposal , we cannot move forward on this matter .
In any event , Article 255 does not , at first sight , allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .
Does not the Council ' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process ?
Mrs Frahm , the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference .
I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions " outwards " , it also applies between the institutions .
As a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions .
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference .
The matter is still open .
I believe that the Commission ' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function , but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter .
For our part , we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area .
It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked .
We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens , decision makers and authorities .
We are very anxious indeed that the EU , too , should move in this direction , and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
One or two years ago , Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context .
The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States .
We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament .
I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning , in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission .
I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference .
It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference , which would mean widening the agenda .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions .
All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims .
It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference .
I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference .
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament , who will surely rally behind this proposal .
We will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .
As far as we are concerned , they will be .
We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .
Question No 5 by ( H-0785 / 99 ) :
Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year , given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks ?
What measures does the Council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?
Mr President , the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question , particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way , and I shall explain how .
The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers .
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species , of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year .
As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX , the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999 .
Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000 , for fishing in French waters .
I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall , over the whole Community fishing area .
In accordance with the principle of relative stability , 90 % of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10 % to France .
Without this transfer from Portuguese waters , the level of the Bay of Biscay TAC would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to France .
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal ' s point of view .
This situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by Mr Ortuondo Larrea , which we also understand .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all .
I understand that Portugal is affected by this .
Today , scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction , and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay .
The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90 % and France ' s at 10 % .
Accordingly , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer , greater account would be taken of France ' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay .
The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen .
In concrete terms , 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5 % of Portugal ' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9 % in 1999 .
These numbers represent , in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council , a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80 % laid down in Council Regulation 685 / 95 .
Question No 6 by ( H-0788 / 99 ) :
The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings , abductions , detentions , intimidation , arson , looting , destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc .
In the light of the above , will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo , as requested by Parliament ?
What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing ?
Mr Alavanos , I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised .
The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts .
It will not be tolerated , and must stop immediately .
It has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to Kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-Albanian minorities are treated .
I think that this is an extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlies the European Union ' s position , is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained .
We have fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security forces in Kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat .
KFOR and the UNMIC police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person ' s ethnic origin .
I would like to thank Mr President-in-Office of the Council .
Today ' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed , and one which I welcome .
However , there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the European Union .
Unfortunately , we have recently witnessed the eradication of Serb , Romany , Turkish , and Croatian minorities in Kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next .
The United Nation ' s , and Mr Kouchner ' s , mission in Kosovo ended in failure .
This failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing , we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side .
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner , who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today .
It is a structure to which the European Union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the European Union have contributed in various ways .
There is one thing , however , that we cannot deny , and that is that Mr Kouchner ' s efforts to return Kosovo ' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive .
Therefore , the responsibility of the European Union has to be seen in a certain context .
These are questions which we should all be asking , but the forum for putting these questions is the United Nations .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures , in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities .
I think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .
We have endeavoured to provide material help .
We have tried to defend peace by taking military action .
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?
Mr Rübig , as I said , I understand your concerns very well .
I know that this is an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented .
We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety .
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency .
Mr Seixas da Costa , I totally agree with you .
The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working , namely Resolution 1244 .
It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses , accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos .
Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo ?
Since the author is not present , Question No 7 lapses .
Question No 8 by ( H-0796 / 99 ) :
However , housing is specifically excluded .
In this regard , we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas .
Question No 9 by ( H-0798 / 99 ) :
The Portuguese Presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and I think that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President-in-Office already referred to this aspect this morning .
We think that the role of food safety , specifically in terms of everything linked to public health , is one of our presidency ' s essential tasks .
It is therefore one of the priorities of our programme .
We shall be developing it in four parallel schemes , in the Agriculture Council , the Health Council , the Consumer Affairs Council and the Internal Market Council .
This is what we shall be trying to achieve during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our efforts to this House .
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
I completely understand your concerns , and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue .
We also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers .
Nevertheless , as you know , this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further .
The Council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .
Mr President , I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber .
I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States .
We have no specific , concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency .
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council ' s scope for action .
Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission ' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself .
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion .
I do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any answers .
I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters .
You must understand that a presidency ' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited .
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission ' s own scope for intervening , through its right of initiative .
The second is to create internationally competitive conditions , which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union , and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion .
The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can , in six months , resolve problems that have always existed .
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency .
Question No 12 by ( H-0801 / 99 ) :
Subject : Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy , the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations ?
I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position .
But there are some questions still outstanding .
There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme .
The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict .
I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .
Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa .
At the same time , there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns , after which we will send the bread .
First of all , Mr Andrews , you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague ' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development .
There is no contradiction between our two positions , quite the opposite .
As you can understand , it would be easy to do so .
All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme , one after the other .
We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve , particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes .
Indeed , in terms of development aid policy , I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States .
Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production ?
Does the presidency intend to do anything about this ?
Since the author is not present , Question No 13 lapses .
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , and I would personally like to welcome him and the Portuguese Presidency .
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs .
Unfortunately , in my case , he did not provide what I would call a satisfactory answer .
Since the Council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .
Saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is , I am afraid , just an excuse .
This is a true example of the Council ' s indifference towards culture , despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance .
I would therefore like to ask the Council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas , hops , cows and Indian hemp .
Mr Marinos , we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the Portuguese Presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension is , I am sure you will appreciate , one of our main concerns .
These cultural dimensions , however , almost always have their own economic dimension in turn , that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives .
This is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the European Union , and especially within the framework of the Council .
This is , and will continue to be , connected with developments within the World Trade Organisation .
But , Mr Marinos , in the EU context , culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with IGC agendas .
Of course , if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference , there might eventually be progress .
It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this .
We will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue .
Mr President , I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it , you would consider it .
Well , I , and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it .
I appreciate that it is a provocative question .
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves .
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens .
I cannot think of a better way to do it .
Can you ?
The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties .
Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree .
It is therefore not out of the question that these issues , which crop up again and again , and which are passed from one conference to another , may be addressed .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion .
I would ask him to be brief .
Mr President , I understand that I have to do this very quickly .
I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas .
In Spain they say a letter to the three kings .
I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports .
Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings .
As I suspected , it was not exactly a procedural motion , but more a closing of the debate .
We thank Mr Seixas da Costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .
I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one .
The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so .
It is not the Portuguese Presidency ' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants , especially those that the European Parliament is asking for .
After this interesting exchange of opinions , and in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , I would like to tell you that Questions Nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing .
That concludes questions to the Council .
Capital tax
The next item is the joint debate on :
the oral question ( B5-0004 / 2000 ) by Mr Désir and others , to the Council , on the Council position on the idea of a capital tax
the oral question ( B5-0005 / 2000 ) by Mr Désir and others , to the Commission , on the Commission position on the idea of a capital tax .
The bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments .
Yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can , in a few hours , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , plunging its whole population into recession .
It could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty .
Many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the Brazilian President , Fernando Cardoso , the Finnish Government , the Canadian Parliament last March and also Lionel Jospin in 1995 .
This question has been debated in several national parliaments of the EU .
The motion also asks that a position document , drawn up by the Commission and Council , should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the IMF .
Europe must play a role in this new international regulation and I am extremely happy that today , with this debate and this motion , this question is now on the agenda of European construction .
Madam President , I do not have a great deal to add on this subject .
The Council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as Professor Tobin suggested .
As it falls to the Commission to propose any such initiative , the Council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue .
Madam President , the revenue basis of the Tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions .
Such transactions , according to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables .
This has also just been underlined by Mr Désir .
Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams , even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue .
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax , such as the Tobin tax , as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .
Mr Désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides .
But if the Tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market .
Put more strongly , in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds , the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens .
In that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .
So the Tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate .
Finally , even if the Tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies , there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected , and that is not the intention .
For the reasons set out above , I cannot see a good reason for introducing a European Tobin tax .
At any rate , the Commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the European Union .
In more direct terms , to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams , this would contravene the Treaty of Rome .
The correct speculative approach , it seems to me , is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question .
Also because I know how many social democrats in this House share our criticism , and not just the economic and financial policy experts .
We know what the problem is : instability on the markets as the result of speculation .
But the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the Commissioner has just so impressively told us , is the result of speculation .
The Tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the EEA in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south-east Asian currencies in 1997 .
In my view , and I say this quite clearly , the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused .
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .
Why do we reject the Tobin tax and consider it so questionable ?
First , and the Commissioner has also confirmed this , because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets .
Even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably .
Secondly , speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify .
Thirdly , unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time , tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes .
Fourthly , technically speaking , this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control .
The measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .
We need stronger banking supervision .
We need to clarify the liability for transactions .
We need a framework of regulations at international level .
We need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the Basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up .
I have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands . I refer to point 9 .
Having listened to the Commissioner just now , we know that the Commission ' s knowledge of the facts will result in a ' no ' to the Tobin tax .
The capital markets do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .
Madam President , the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one .
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies .
We need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is .
We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past .
It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information .
It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is .
We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .
I will have to repeat these arguments , modestly , in this intervention , because the same issue has arisen once again .
Firstly , there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets .
Furthermore , the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appears simply impossible .
This is a false debate whose aim is purely political , and has no basis or technical viability .
I suppose that the first thing they say will be , ' let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the Union ' .
In itself , globalisation is positive .
The economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level .
This is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital .
Any analysis of economic development in recent years , if objective , will show , through the figures , that they have no political colour or orientation .
As I have said , we are not opposed to such a study .
Madam President , Commissioner , the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature .
The main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system .
In this respect , Mr Bolkestein , the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the Tobin tax .
Secondly , the motion does not say that we want a solely European initiative .
There should be no confusion in this debate . As environmentalists , we do not want an excuse for a motion .
Although a study produced by the Commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .
This argument is therefore not relevant .
I will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments .
However , I would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 10 .
Obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning .
Having said this , our Group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents .
This invites the Commission to present a report within six months .
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising . What are the respective places of people and finance in today ' s economy ?
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world ' s currency markets . This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services .
By putting finance at the helm , this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere .
It has led to a growth in mergers , acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets .
Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing .
Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries , to the point of collapse , as in Asia , Russia and Brazil .
No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information .
In this respect , all ideas deserve to be considered , including the Tobin tax which is important , just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged .
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this .
In any case , the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone .
Madam President , I too am delighted that we are having this debate . I only regret that it has been so long in coming .
Our world is now dominated by a single logic or , I could say , a single god of money at work instead of people at work .
With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days ' speculation , the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals .
It was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre , thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible .
If the world ' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the Tobin tax , the fact that tax was liable to be paid in Europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas .
This has already been made clear a number times in this debate .
It is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries .
There should therefore be a universal application : it is not enough that the G7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved .
Furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed .
With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises , it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation .
For that reason , as Mr Karas also said , we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value .
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way .
Although it seems a reasonable scheme , the Tobin tax is not without its problems , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which I do not believe there will .
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital .
For that reason , the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world ' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity , which has nothing to do with the real economy .
Hence , as Mr Karas has stated to his credit , our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax .
Madam President , I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders .
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary .
The size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies .
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche , burying jobs , lives and industries across the globe .
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy .
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , stockbrokers and option traders .
Of course , this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation .
Europe , Japan and the US - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .
I am disappointed in the EPP .
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .
Yes , I am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow .
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind .
The tax has the support of 47 % of the people in the UK , according to a recent survey by War on Want .
In France it has had enormous resonance , particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty .
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament , the Council or the Commission .
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : " It has not been done before " .
One of the main demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this is not by chance .
The proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich European countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism .
Everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects . The Members on the right should note this .
It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south , particularly those in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle .
In order to fully achieve its objective , the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries .
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south .
We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares .
We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action .
We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly .
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6 % of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea .
We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations .
Nor do I believe that this is impracticable .
Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries , the other EU Member States , China , Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax ?
There must be an overriding economic interest .
Why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiated , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions , all the so-called cash transactions , currency futures and options ?
Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive .
Madam President , we are not asking for more bureaucracy , as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago .
We are looking for solutions .
Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea .
The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question .
" The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation , the more rules are needed " , as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle .
He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union 's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations .
We citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .
To continue would be economic suicide .
Honourable Members , Commissioner , it is often said that Europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector , but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector .
The fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains .
Speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are , in turn , generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious .
Over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis .
The danger is too great for us to ignore .
We ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .
Modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the Tobin proposal and others , which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start .
That is what we are lacking , Commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackling speculation .
Madam President , Mr Bolkestein , the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable .
We needed a Greek Member to finally tell us what this Tobin tax means .
You reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it .
That the Right opposes taxes is quite understandable , except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions , or rather billions , into Switzerland .
We all know that !
But now I call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital .
It has never been done in south-east Asia , it has never been done in Europe , and I can understand why Mr Karas from Austria has left the chamber , given Austria ' s financial record .
They are all tarred with the same dirty brush !
We need a Tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .
Madam President , I am totally appalled by the Commission ' s , i.e. Mr Bolkestein ' s , political ignorance !
He should perhaps use his position on the Tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all !
Madam President , I too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre .
Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested .
We have asset inflation of global proportions .
As a result , speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets , causing growing economic instability which , in turn , jeopardises the entire economy .
And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result .
We can take action against this ; it is possible .
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the Commission , but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe .
That too is feasible .
And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble !
It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer .
The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored .
Madam President , let us indeed tax money speculation : it does not produce anything new .
The tax would be targeted at the right place : at the speculators .
Who is going to defend these speculators , when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax ?
Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions .
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres , the tax havens , of which there are 62 in all .
The Union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .
The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems .
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect .
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries , and you see how we are today .
The truth is the greatest problem is a political one : they do not want to tax capital , but raise personal taxation instead .
In the end tax would politicise the global , undemocratic system of financial power .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must challenge the monopoly the world ' s speculative elite have on planning the world ' s economy by remaining outside the tax system .
Madam President , may I begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and , above all of course , Mr Désir , for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening .
Whatever one may think about the topic of debate , it is evident that it is an important one .
This is why it has been around for years , and it is satisfying that the Commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response .
I would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the Member of your Parliament , Mr Gasòliba .
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon , and I share his view .
A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates .
I think that he is correct in this regard .
I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates .
I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks , and that is why I am reiterating them here .
Madam President , could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other ?
Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement .
In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market , I am , in other words , opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions .
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .
Madam President , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations , there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax , as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers .
It has unfortunately been observed , I have to say , that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures .
This indicates how difficult these dossiers are .
If we have not been able to reach agreement internally , I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners .
I think that this will be problematic .
Madam President , Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets .
In order to remove these causes , one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question .
Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English ' good governance ' ?
Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates ?
That the markets for production factors , including the labour market , operate flexibly ?
That is not always the case .
So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first .
In addition - and this has also been mentioned already , for example by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm , but also by others - there is a need for more supervision .
More supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally , for example by means of the IMF .
Madam President , according to various Members of your Parliament , more funding should still be made available for major projects .
For example , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler spoke in English about ' long-term capital for long-term projects ' - this is an obvious issue .
Madam President , I should like to leave it here .
As far as the resolution is concerned , of which I have seen a draft , the Commission will await the vote and will , based on this , determine its stance .
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate .
I have received four motions for a resolution , tabled pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Madam President , unfortunately I do not have your mastery of the French language .
But I would be obliged if Mr Bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which I think he cannot do at the same time as talking to Mrs Randzio-Plath .
Could you please draw his attention to the fact that I have something to say to him ?
Monsieur Bolkestein , je veux vous dire quelque chose !
Unfortunately , my Dutch is not as good as yours .
But I would rather like to say something else to you .
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission .
We want to examine the possibility of introducing a Tobin tax .
It will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this .
From a political point of view , I always fret when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these things !
It is not your job , it is our job to decide on that .
It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament .
I just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .
We can do so without going off at other tangents . I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously .
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that includes the Tobin tax !
Mr Désir , I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .
If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled , it will be included .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m.
( The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m. )
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
Mr President , I simply wanted to pass on some news . There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid .
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died .
On behalf of my Group , I once again condemn these terrorist acts .
Thank you , Mrs Fraga Estévez .
We had heard about this regrettable incident .
Unfortunately , the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society . I note your comments with particular keenness , as you may expect , given that I too am Spanish .
( The Minutes were approved )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 21 January 2000 .
Madam President , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy .
Mrs Angelilli , thank you . I have taken note of your comment .
Agenda
The next item is the order of business .
If you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council , and Mr Romano Prodi , President of the Commission .
Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure .
This debate is topical , exceptionally important and urgent .
We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it .
( Applause )
Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?
If you ratify ...
Mr Gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute . I know that you always take particular care to ensure that the Rules of Procedure are observed .
Madam President , I thought I had three minutes .
Do forgive me .
We have heard one speaker in favour and one against .
I shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote .
( Parliament gave its assent )
This debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business .
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
Talks in Austria on forming a government
The next item is the debate on the talks in Austria on forming a government .
I shall immediately give the floor to Mr Seixas da Costa , President-in-Office of the Council .
Madam President , President of the Commission , President-in-Office of the Council , the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public .
Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts .
In any event , these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party .
I will say one thing . For many years I was a traitor to my country ; at least that was General Franco ' s view .
President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar ' s eyes , and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE .
I also believe that the Commission , or President Prodi , has acted as a guardian of the Treaties .
However , I would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he described the Commission as a European government .
A government must have more nerve and more courage .
That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment .
( Applause )
Secondly , Madam President , we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people .
We should not be so politically partisan .
The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture .
We all took part in it , not just one group .
I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence .
We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
Madam President , my group welcomes this debate because it is a defining moment .
This is the first time in the history of the modern European project that we stand at the threshold of seeing the mainstreaming of a party of the extreme right .
That is deeply disturbing .
The FPÖ contends that if one reads their literature and their programme , there is much in it that one could share .
That may be , but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we Liberal Democrats had with the Austrian FPÖ in our Liberal International family .
As early as 1986 , we had cause to believe that Mr Jörg Haider was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with decency and modern liberalism .
In November of 1991 , after a long internal debate in Liberal International and many visits to Vienna to discuss issues , we suspended the FPÖ from membership and in July 1993 we expelled them .
We expelled them then and we continue to reject what Mr Haider stands for now .
Let me share what we learned in that long experience .
There were many in our ranks who said " read the text " .
There were many more in our ranks who said " read the subtext " , " look at the context " .
Words in politics can be incendiary , can be inflammatory , or can be conciliatory .
We found that Mr Jörg Haider , as a wordsmith , has been a voice for racism and for xenophobia .
He is a man who plays on fear and who has exploited vulnerability .
That is why this debate is important - to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism , something profound is happening in Europe today .
( Applause )
I hasten to add that our quarrel is not with the Austrian people .
We respect the rights of the Austrian people to their own democratic process .
Every right-thinking person in this House believes that these are universal and indivisible without regard to colour , class or creed .
We must promote and defend those rights , all the while saying to the people of Austria : our quarrel is not with you .
I wish to say with regard to the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it .
It may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure but we accept Mr President-in-Office , that it is rooted in idealism and for that reason we are inclined to support it .
I share with President Prodi a preference for the Community method and we must look at Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty .
Article 7 talks about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent breaches of our fundamental values .
We must find a way as institutions to benchmark and give meaning to this so that it has a reality and a substance .
Then we can work together by the Community method to root out this cancer within our midst .
I want to say Madame President some words to Mr Schüssel .
Mr Schüssel is a man with an honourable record in European politics .
He now intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger .
Mr Schüssel - you are assuming a very serious , personal , national and European responsibility .
That responsibility , which you Mr Schüssel now take on , is to respect the letter and the spirit of the European Treaties .
Finally , Madame President , this is a debate which touches on the heart of our democratic values and institutions and calls to mind that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance .
It is a dogged insistence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this Union that we will not as Europeans countenance turning the clock back .
( Loud applause )
Madam President , in my group ' s opinion , the European Union today faces a political and ethical challenge which is without precedent since the creation of the Union .
The European Union has certainly previously known situations where there were people in a Member State government whose ideas and actions were in contradiction to the guiding values of the Union .
However , with Haider and his men , we would see the extreme right , openly racist , anti-Semitic and xenophobic , promoted to the rank of co-ruler of our Community .
Of course , there can be no question of casting opprobrium upon the people of Austria .
Any action which can be taken must , in our opinion , serve the twofold function of proscribing Haider without , however , isolating Austrian society .
Democrats in this country now need our support more than ever .
The great joining of forces in protest in Vienna on 12 November last year must now undergo developments suited to the new situation .
We must have dialogue with them and join forces with them , stand at their side in order to offer the people of Austria some alternative prospects .
Finally , we must ask ourselves : how did we come to be in this position ?
This debate is now before us , but each and every one of us , male and female , is going to assume their responsibilities without delay .
( Applause )
We have never before seen such serious , clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a Member State .
However , up till now , Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation .
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated , but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government .
( Applause from the right ) It is via diplomacy , persuasion , knowledge , and solidarity , and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles .
Bilateral relations involve the States , so the 14 do not come into this .
So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region . However , we already knew this .
However , today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union ' s democratic role .
We believe in Europe , while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union .
This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks .
We have built a Europe with an unstable market , not a Europe with principles , rights and politics .
And these are the consequences !
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria .
There are risks , as we are all aware , but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach .
We could , if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested , require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Madame President , my group , the EDD , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate .
We cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich .
We also , however , deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the European Union .
My party at home are certainly not racists , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well .
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain ' s Parliament if we are elected ?
Madame President , the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament .
I believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .
Your Parliament , may I suggest , Madame President , should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country .
Then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , Madame President and only then , may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union .
Madam President , as a representative of the Freedom Party , I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria .
Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it , rightly or wrongly .
This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP , due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999 , when the previous government was voted out of office .
This is the citizen of a state ' s prerogative , for it is the founding principle of a democracy .
When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down , the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support .
We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here !
When we suddenly refused this offer , an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day .
The FPÖ party is established in Austria ' s political landscape .
The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments .
There is prejudice at work here , which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle .
Shame on you Mr Bertinotti !
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda .
Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist !
On the contrary , you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did .
Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices , you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose .
The attacks against Austria ' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people .
That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest .
The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy , the rights of the opposition , commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour ....
( The President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , to begin with , I would like to make one thing abundantly clear : Austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion .
Austria is a stable democracy ; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary .
Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there .
There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .
We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria .
Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present .
Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship , many people were perpetrators too , although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt .
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union .
My country ' s place is not outside the European Union but in it ...
... , with all the rights and commitments that this entails !
My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values !
( Applause )
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Representatives of the Commission , it is a black day for Austria and for Europe .
Not even Mr Sichrovsky ' s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel ' s words of appeasement can do anything to change that .
For the day has dawned : two irresponsible politicians , consumed with a lust for power , are selling Austria ' s image , political role , and to some extent even its economic interests , down the river !
( Applause , heckling )
They are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government .
However , my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties , ...
... and that includes their representatives in this Parliament .
Mr Poettering , it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am , albeit for different reasons , for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions .
The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play , i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system .
However , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this , into our political system , and into the Europe of today , than any other extreme right-wing movement .
( Applause )
This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured .
That is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP - is sustained rather than kept in check .
I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government .
However , by the same token , there is another Austria , the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government .
I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria !
( Applause )
The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today , the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism .
For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy , or even against a relapse into barbarism .
Please support the Austrian people against this government !
( Applause )
Madam President , this is an historic moment , as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values .
We see this , now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which , as is known , does not respect all these values .
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration .
As important is the fact that Austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support , as none of us wishes to isolate the country .
We know that most Austrians respect these values .
They have also shown how they feel : not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria .
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time .
I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy .
I also appeal to the Austrian President , that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces .
Madam President , I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , Francis Wurtz , reminded us of just now .
I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider ' s party .
Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today : this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational , neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary .
This danger does not concern Austria , it concerns Europe .
We are talking about us , not Austria .
Not only the Alpine region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat .
The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation .
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz ; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past .
This is the change we must impose on the Commission ' s action .
Madam President , we are debating an extremely serious issue .
A simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party ' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder .
Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State .
However , that is not the problem .
The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party .
Our answer to this crucial question is no .
( Applause )
Konrad Adenauer once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you .
History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided .
( Loud applause )
It is not true to say that , when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe , this is merely a question of national sovereignty .
For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances .
Let us learn the lessons of the past .
They put their own petty squabbles first , and the rest is history .
We must make a rapid , strong and united response .
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President , Mr Poettering . We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance .
So our response must be rapid and strong .
Of course , the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable ; I was almost going to say ' irreparable ' .
And when that day comes , it is too late .
We must therefore find a political solution .
Our response must be rapid .
If today we do not staunchly support the Council , then history will judge us , saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement .
Today , we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .
Madam President , this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa , who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States .
This debate , and the background to it , reinforced the point that the Council , the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists .
My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of Austria ' s Freedom Party .
We were also outraged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excesses of the former USSR .
Even today , surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China ' s Communist Party .
This , Madam President , is the hypocrisy of the left .
So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards , especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States .
We should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results .
This requires action to address the underlying causes , including an examination of the electoral process itself .
That should be our task , not political posturing .
Madam President , Representative of the Council , Commissioner , a week ago , the big international Holocaust Conference ended in Stockholm .
Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today ' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism .
Secondly , I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations .
We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours .
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned .
That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria .
It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened .
We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union .
The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values , something which we take seriously . Something has happened .
The European Union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine .
Madam President , as everyone has said , this is a very important day . It is the day of the first debate of European political life .
And this is not pure chance .
I feel that today ' s meeting is not a meeting of Europe , our institutions , with Austria or Mr Haider ' s party .
It is the meeting of Europe with itself , with its raison d ' être , with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber .
This Chamber was not made for goods , it was not made for money .
This Chamber , and the European institutions , were build to uphold values , morality and a certain spirit .
The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider ' s party , the FPÖ , to find nationalist glorification , populism and racial superiority in every chapter .
Reading only one sentence which my friend , Mr Vidal-Quadras , has previously mentioned , " The nation is defined by its location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally . "
Well , we cannot accept such statements .
( Applause )
Madam President , we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as , fortunately , are a great many other Members too .
The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too .
Because what is it that unites us in Europe ? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything .
The Austrian Freedom Party leader , Mr Haider , has repeatedly repudiated these values .
He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness .
He is a dangerous man .
The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders .
Values should take precedence over power .
We deplore , therefore , what is happening in Austria . In fact , we were shaken by it .
We are extremely disappointed . As a last resort , we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives .
We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty .
We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right .
Madam President , Austria awaits a heavy responsibility .
Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself ?
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ?
Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days ?
From all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen Haider .
Who would want this to happen ?
Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?
Europe is a community of law .
Democracy , respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold .
It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the Treaty .
( Applause )
I am duty- bound to say to this House , there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the Commission on this issue .
We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the President this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday .
Secondly , we said , in very specific terms , that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria .
There is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all .
I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , Franz Fischler .
That surely is in everyone ' s interests .
In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday .
We will continue to do that , Madam President , without fear or favour .
That is our duty .
It is also a matter of conviction .
My final point is this . We understand the context of this essential debate .
We understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism .
And , when we recall that , like many others on all sides of this House , my and my colleagues ' instincts are naturally aroused .
However , the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct .
And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning .
That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law .
Without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people .
We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate , ' necessarily with acute vigilance ' .
Does the Commission support the Council ?
Thank you , Commissioner Kinnock .
I think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
The debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
Recourse to the precautionary principle
The next item is the Commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle .
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen .
The precautionary principle is not a new concept .
It also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the Rio Declaration and most recently the Bio-Safety Protocol .
The essence of the precautionary principle is clear .
However , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years .
Events such as the BSE and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary .
In view of this growing interest , the Commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle .
The basic aim of the communication is twofold .
The Commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental , human , animal and plant health .
Of course , this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures , but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear .
As such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics .
The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society .
It is therefore political by nature .
However , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper .
Measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut .
They must be non-discriminatory in their application , that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin .
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken .
For example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved .
All these elements have to apply cumulatively .
This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use .
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
I have three short questions , the first being as follows .
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice .
Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry , Foreign Trade , Competition and the Internal Market ?
I am sure that your answer to this will be " yes " but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ?
My next question , Mrs Wallström , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ?
Lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ?
In other words , will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ?
. Thank you very much , Dagmar Roth-Behrendt , for these questions .
Of course , this is shared by the whole Commission .
This is a common communication which was written by the three of us , David Byrne , Erkki Liikanen and myself , but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today .
It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission .
So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document .
Yes , I would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example .
And , I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental areas .
It has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of course also when it comes to human health .
So , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .
Needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power .
We might ask ourselves , what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ?
The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied , provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists . I would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?
How would you describe this ?
What establishes a recognised minority ?
If a political decision is involved , I would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?
The Commission ?
The Council ?
And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this ?
What is the role of the scientific committees ?
What , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?
Finally , will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ?
These are my three questions .
. Yes , Mr President , that is true .
There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear , but I will try to answer some questions .
Who will take the decision , who are the decision-makers ?
Well , that depends on who the legislators are .
This is part of risk management .
They have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case .
However , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .
It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete .
That is , of course , where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science .
It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done , but there is no question of changing the scientific base .
We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future .
You have to see this as a tool for risk management .
You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that is available .
You have to assess all that and evaluate the science .
Then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .
So , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today .
Mr President , I have a question concerning an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle .
It is about brominated flame retardants .
It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered . There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment .
There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks , while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are .
Recently , both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants .
I am wondering , therefore , if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative .
.
( SV ) Mr President , thank you very much , Mr Sjöstedt , for this question .
The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one .
It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done .
We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do .
Allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban .
There may be a series of different measures which can be taken .
It ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpreted as a ban .
Where brominated flame retardants are concerned , there may eventually be a ban , but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken .
This issue is extremely topical .
The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done .
You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier .
Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean ?
I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops .
Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do ?
.
( SV ) Mr President , I am pleased to be able to tell you that , in Montreal , we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety .
We succeeded there in agreeing , at an international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle .
I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol .
I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle . We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted .
It is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool .
Mr President , I have two questions .
I shall try to be very brief indeed .
The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle .
As I have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood .
Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out , including a cost-benefit analysis ?
In that case , I am rather concerned , because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced .
Instead , the precautionary principle should come first .
My second question concerns the burden of proof .
I remember Margot Wallström being introduced as Commissioner in the Committee .
At that time , she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof . In other words , a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous .
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now .
. ( SV ) Thank you , Mrs Schörling .
These are two important questions , and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them .
It is not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis .
The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof .
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases .
I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this .
It is , however , perfectly correct that , when it comes , for example , to chemicals , we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof .
Mr President , I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible .
I will give an example : a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind . It is therefore a teratogenic substance .
Very well , it is a fungicide , it kills off mould .
This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory , perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests .
So I want to put this question to you . When human health is at stake , or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected , should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis ?
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high ; there are no benefits that can compensate for this .
.
Naturally , it is not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided .
Nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure .
In those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .
I cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it , namely when I was on a visit to Africa .
At a hospice for AIDS patients , I met two Irish Catholic nuns who were caring for dying AIDS patients .
They were the first to say that , each day , they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there .
We must be very careful about how we use resources .
I believe we can learn something from this .
We must , of course , always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help .
As is also explained in the present communication , it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis .
Consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge , and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people ' s health .
Mr President , it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions !
Commissioner , I would like to come back again to my first question , when I asked about the other Commissioners , for it may have sounded as though I was in jest .
Indeed you responded in kind , as I knew you would do .
I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked , that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union .
I have good reason for asking this .
As you rightly said , the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific evidence .
That is exactly what it is all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here , Commissioner !
I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts , for example with the United States .
We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise .
Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment , health and trade .
This constitutes a good example , therefore .
We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily .
We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
Intergovernmental Conference
Mr President , I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts .
Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration .
The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement .
The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century .
The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work .
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union ' s institutional bodies .
I will not repeat which ones , because everyone knows .
Granted this , the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which , properly addressed , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union ' s institutions .
Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which , for that very reason , are highly visible to the European public .
In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference .
All the same , whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference .
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us .
Mr President , the Group of the European People ' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki .
It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content , because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the Union ' s institutions .
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States .
It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform .
We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union .
Having said this , Mr President , this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference .
In theory , we could have done so .
We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th .
Mr President , I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly .
The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament ' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues .
Mr President , I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself .
However , the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference .
This is for one very simple reason : according to the agreements made in Helsinki , this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues , which are currently decided unanimously , being decided by a qualified majority .
Therefore , the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase .
It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament .
Therefore , since the qualified majority will be extended , there will also be more codecision with Parliament .
However , this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union .
That it is what we are doing .
We believe that , in the political design of the Union , other issues need to be dealt with .
These include , amongst others , the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues , which have made much progress recently , but which must be incorporated into the Treaty .
Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and work began on its wording yesterday , which I believe has started very positively .
We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union ' s institutions .
We will talk about this on another day .
Today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the Group of the European People ' s Party , Mr President , is ready to give that green light .
Mr President , for the Socialist Group I can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the Constitutional Affairs Committee .
The Amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves .
Let us call them the first three subjects of the IGC .
These first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our Member States during the last IGC .
They did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study .
They need a political deal .
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda .
There are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at , especially before such a large widening of the Union to so many new countries .
Nobody is asking for a Christmas tree .
Nobody is asking for an IGC of the Maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated .
However , there are six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .
There is time .
Remember the IGC that led to the Single European Act .
It lasted only five months .
The IGC that led to the enormous Maastricht Treaty lasted a year .
A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda .
I am pleased to see that the Commission shares our view .
The Commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what Parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles .
I thank the Commission for doing that even if , of course , I do not agree with everything the Commission said .
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward .
Nonetheless the Commission has provided a service and I pay tribute to Commissioner Barnier who is here with us today for doing that .
They have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this IGC .
That is all to the good .
The Parliament , the Council presidency and the Commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda .
We should no longer be worried that the agenda for the IGC will be restricted .
That is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 Member States yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner .
It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights .
It is vital that the IGC prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the Treaty .
One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court .
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention .
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy .
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .
Moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it .
I nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform .
The events in Austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in Europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the Member States .
How , though , is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i.e. before enlargement takes place ?
That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference .
We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future .
My group , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs .
You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand .
The politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all .
That is why we need transparency .
In this way , Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .
There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to .
After all , what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals ?
No , to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union .
The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone .
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union .
Of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States .
We will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform , as the Council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny .
We need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small States .
This is something I would stress , particularly with my being an MEP for one of the major Member States .
There is one final issue I would like to raise .
Parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the Treaty in the area of economic policy .
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes .
What we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the Union ' s policies to date .
It is all about creating a socially just Europe .
A socially just Europe is still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the Union ' s policies .
It must be adhered to in the interests of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement .
Our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which , when taken together , form a real alternative resolution .
In them we say that the forthcoming IGC must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty .
The federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint , but this is a totally superficial concept .
Quite the opposite , in an enlarged Europe , Mr President , the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding .
The Europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker , as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending .
We are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles , one which are still , unfortunately , outside the European Parliament and the Commission .
A flexible Europe , is a Europe which respects its national democracies , which relies on the support of its nations , its national patriotisms , instead of continually persecuting them .
It is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats , not the constraining , convoluted decision making procedures which the Commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radicals and I would like to say to the President of the Council that he has seen what Parliament ' s opinion is .
This is the message that Parliament is sending to the Council .
This message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .
We shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the IGC on 14 February , but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content .
There is clearly a more ambitious goal .
Mr President , the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference .
These are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day .
Brussels knows best .
Mr Prodi also announced greater transparency , but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step , and that is not only my assessment , but also that of the European Ombudsman .
There is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of Member States .
Under the banner of " progress towards transparency " , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public .
It is , of course , thoroughly Orwellian .
I want to ask Mr Prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the House which is not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .
In addition , we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions , which may be used for any purposes whatsoever . It is therefore ...
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Portuguese Council Presidency ' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this Intergovernmental Conference with well-considered ideas and a high degree of openness .
We as a European Parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve .
The preparations the Commission has made so far are on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the European Parliament ' s motions are anything to go by .
There is more to be said on that score .
It is crucially important for this Intergovernmental Conference to score a hat trick ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .
In the end , it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens .
At the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the European Union .
If we have been having a different debate here in this Chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is .
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade .
This is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre-requisite to the European Union ' s being able to function come what may .
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned , and legislation and in relation to treaties , which entail changes being made to legislation .
Of course we also want to extend the European Parliament ' s corresponding powers in this area .
In addition , we as a European Parliament are going to have to take action in relation to Economic and Monetary Union , for there is a lack of supervision in this area .
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council , which is an unacceptable way to go on .
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann , I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank .
However , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side .
The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this .
We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference .
The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .
There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to .
The European Union needs few , if any , new instruments , and it does not need any new competences .
What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice .
For this reason , we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out , on behalf of the citizens , the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty .
In my view , that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on .
If we succeed in making progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union .
This is the crux of the matter .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage .
You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries , and therefore in their parliaments .
I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments , which were represented by competent and exacting delegations .
The aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging .
However , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the Intergovernmental Conference .
We are counting on the Portuguese Presidency , we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the Commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , only a strengthened Europe can cope with enlargement .
Only a strengthened Europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction .
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and , hence , a widened IGC agenda .
The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and , unfortunately , turned a deaf ear to this Parliament .
Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor ' s book .
It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC .
In many ways , they share the same interests and the same insights .
An essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this Parliament ' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty .
Of all priorities , this one is the most pressing .
What is the Commission ' s verdict on this ?
There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission .
Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States , but we owe them to ourselves .
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement , we will drown in our own political quagmire .
If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC , then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this .
Because of the situation in Austria , this is a dark day for Europe .
It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .
In order to assert our fundamental values , they need to be laid down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this IGC , I believe we owe Europe a constitution .
Mr President , the draft resolution we are now discussing requires , precisely as before , that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions .
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this .
I am convinced that this is an error of judgement .
A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement .
A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries .
Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level .
It is not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union .
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank . This is untenable .
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic , the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered .
The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity .
Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible .
The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective .
Article 56 of the Treaty , prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control .
In the majority of EU countries , there are now governments dominated by social democrats .
It is remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union .
It also , of course , damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital .
The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is , however , important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States .
It is the Member States ' parliaments , or people voting in referenda , who are to direct the development of the Treaty .
It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .
Mr President , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text , which I shall vote for , even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it .
Nevertheless , the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right .
This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution .
And it is not a question of links with the past ; it is a question of prospects for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this .
They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles .
However , that is precisely what is happening .
I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon .
On 14 February , we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000 .
This is a big task but it can be done .
I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement .
In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important " Amsterdam leftovers " .
In relation to the latter point , Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining .
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers , provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission .
I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point .
At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution .
We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty .
In other words , if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions .
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully .
We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents .
The Treaty of Amsterdam , Mr President , has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe .
In any case , this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon .
I think that , under the present rules of the Treaties , the European Parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation .
On the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms , in collaboration with the Commission whose own proposals are worthy of note .
We must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliaments .
That way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms .
They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone .
The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive .
It may be easy to come up with solutions , but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term .
I will mention two point that may create tension .
One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries .
Europe is not , nor can it become a classic federal state .
The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union , which is a union of states and peoples .
The other area of conflict is more difficult .
Owing to the imminent increase in membership , the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective .
This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly .
By its very nature , however , the European Union is , and will remain , a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution .
Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist . Of course they do , but they are not unlimited .
If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer .
I am , however , optimistic .
Mr President , the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened .
The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union .
The Commission ' s current President , Mr Prodi , and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .
Last November , the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe : the onion skin model .
In the next resolution on the IGC , Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility .
Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings , as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party .
My colleagues , Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken , somewhat sceptically , about some aspects of the matter in hand .
I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions .
This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .
May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament .
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly .
Scotland , with a population of 5 million , has eight seats in this House at the moment ; Denmark and Finland , with the same population , have sixteen .
What will happen to a place like Scotland , which I represent here ?
It will become totally invisible !
A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view .
Mr President , to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new .
It has been said many times .
This time , however , it is true . We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement .
The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not .
Will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?
That is the debate , and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference , its agenda or its method .
It is clear that the Council , for the moment , has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place .
That puts enlargement in danger .
It jeopardises any prospect of political union and , of course , it is difficult for the public to understand .
The Council must realise that , if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations , the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further .
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion .
We want an Intergovernmental Conference , but not this one .
Must there be an IGC ?
Of course there must , but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference .
The agenda must go much further .
We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .
Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative .
We must clearly set firm objectives .
The functionalist approach is over , for better or for worse .
The functionalist approach has brought us to this point .
Have we achieved results ?
As far as we are concerned , after producing the opinion expected from the Commission , according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty , we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated .
We know , I know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us .
I would just like to make a few comments , after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups .
Firstly , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda .
Indeed , it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the Commission framed for its own opinion , but using all the terms thereof , plus everything between the lines .
We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers , which is , in any case , an incorrect label .
I do not like the term ' leftovers ' any more than Richard Corbett does .
They are the first but they are not the only subjects , Mr Seguro , that the conference must deal with .
This proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate , by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers .
However , these Council proceedings must be carefully prepared .
Throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying .
I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be .
We now await , therefore , with great interest , ladies and gentlemen of the House , your next opinion , in which you will specify Parliament ' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations .
Quite probably , our points of view and our positions will not always be the same .
There will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal .
The important thing is that we are consistent , and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner .
Our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subjects , is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully .
Finally , I should like to make three additional comments , quite briefly , Mr President .
Such dialogue between the national parliaments , the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important .
I have said , furthermore , that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments .
Tomorrow , I shall be in London . In a fortnight ' s time , I shall be in Berlin .
In three weeks ' time , I shall be in Paris , and I shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another .
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and I should like to thank you for taking it .
It will have to initiate these negotiations .
Concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .
It is all the work which is going to be carried out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few months , which is extremely important .
After having heard Prime Minister Guterres , the Minister of Foreign Affairs and yourself , I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations .
It can count on the partnership of the Commission over the next few months .
Finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations .
These are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain .
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament , Ministers , Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens , to public debate .
As far as the Commission is concerned , it will , ladies and gentlemen , be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate .
Cross-border services
I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative , and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today .
These have , in fact , clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits .
However , the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue .
The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services .
There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here .
Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises .
It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement .
All provisions , i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights , should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services .
Consequently , I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned .
I also believe that Parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission ' s proposal .
I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis .
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms .
Likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued , namely under the terms of an opposition procedure .
I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs .
However , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months .
I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee ' s amendments , which they adopted unanimously .
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions .
Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report .
I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons .
I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology , i.e. the correct way to quote .
This would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future .
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio ' s reports .
On a final note , I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports , which were far from easy to produce .
That is why he deserves special mention !
.
If you allow me , Mr President , I would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate .
May I say how the Commission welcomes the European Parliament ' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third-country employees , the topic of the debate .
I am extremely grateful for the work that Mrs Berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge .
I would also thank Mrs Palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
The Commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by Parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards .
If the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more , or all , Member States , the procedure would be more flexible still .
The Commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card .
However , I do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a Member State .
The Commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice .
An efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market .
It seems over the top to us for other Member States to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards .
Indeed , it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a Member State to be admitted to other Member States too .
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification .
Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired .
Following completion of the service , it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided .
That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio ' s Amendment No 22 in both respects .
As far as the second proposal is concerned , the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal .
These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments .
I hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speakers have contributed , I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments .
Mr President , tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , as well as the amended version .
I propose to confine my comments to two areas .
Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense .
There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account .
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment .
Then there are the interests of the Member States , which , being on the receiving end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario .
There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card .
Alternatively , I might have no directive at all .
Neither outcome would be satisfactory .
Perhaps this is also why , as is rumoured to be the case , the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well .
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution .
We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world , but once these have been overcome , implementation is as easy as it possibly could be .
Therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more Member States .
Accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .
Consequently , I too have to say that I am in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission .
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution .
Allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .
Most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers .
We all know that there are still various parts of the Treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as EC .
We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law .
However , before the elections we - the Council , the Commission , Parliament , the press , unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens .
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU .
They have now got to grips with " EU " .
We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver " EC service provision card " and not " EU service provision card " .
It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in , this is the one that counts in their eyes .
I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction .
Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed .
One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism .
This directive is , of course , not in itself directly about that .
That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger .
We welcome that , and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law .
Nevertheless , I have tabled an amendment .
Mrs Berger , in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6 , you mention legal security .
The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit , since all that does is create legal insecurity .
If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date , it must end on that date .
Legal security requires this .
There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .
It therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity .
In the case of a non-Schengen state , in the last paragraph of Amendment No 22 , that possibility is contemplated , and is perfectly expressed , and I believe this provides greater legal security .
The discretional power of the State , which you propose in point e of your Amendment No 10 , seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report .
I would therefore ask Members to examine my amendment carefully , and I hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .
On the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across Europe and to give effect to the recent court cases Mrs Berger referred to in her opening remarks .
However , in the case of the United Kingdom , we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable .
Partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the United Kingdom .
Under the arrangements contained in the Treaties , the United Kingdom retains its border controls .
If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process .
For that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals .
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services .
The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises .
Why do I think we need the directive so much ?
Three reasons and they are as follows : on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU , in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market .
Therefore , whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions , I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible .
My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission . Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations ?
How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ?
Indeed , they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided .
There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory .
I assume that , although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known , their number will most definitely not be low .
So , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation .
The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card .
I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner .
Having also studied the amendments submitted , I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow .
May I , to finish off , thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having , in that way , added an important degree of meaning to her report ?
I think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market .
Mr President , thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail .
In the course of my speech , I would also like to address Lord Inglewood regarding the remark he has just made .
Regarding the first proposal on third-country employees , the Commission is prepared to adopt Amendments Nos 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 22 .
Amendments Nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too , provided the situation of posting is established in the Member State in which the service provider is established .
The Commission also agrees with Amendment No 11 , except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months , as I explained just now .
We also welcome Amendment No 13 insofar as , as a result of this , the card ' s area of applicability is extended from one Member State to all Member States .
In terms of comitology , Amendments Nos 14 and 21 also apply in part , insofar as the rights of Parliament are concerned .
I regret that the Commission has found Amendment No 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the Member State in which the service is provided are concerned .
In this respect , the Commission supports Amendment No 22 , as I have already mentioned . The other amendments are unacceptable .
Personally , I am rather in favour of the term " EU service provision card " which is proposed in Amendment No 1 , but the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this .
As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96 / 71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force , no change is necessary .
Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued .
Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States .
Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable , given my thoughts on Amendment No 10 .
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal .
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable .
As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term " self-employed " is concerned , the Commission will , as I have already remarked , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged .
I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood ' s remark .
This applies , as already stated , to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium , where it was recently of relevance .
With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas , I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country .
The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries .
The question is , furthermore , one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way .
In my opinion , this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate .
On behalf of the Commission , I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point .
I will keep myself free in this connection .
Finally , I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Berger .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Bolkestein .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Court of First Instance
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report , which , on reading it , gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council ' s draft decision .
For this reason , I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho .
Behind these principles , Mr President , lies the justice system .
However , justice delayed is justice denied , and we must reflect on this notion .
The working document prepared by the Court itself contains alarming information .
For this reason , the draft reform , which has been drawn up by the rapporteur , Vice-President Marinho , is to be welcomed .
We have to offer solutions which , while provisional , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice .
These are two of Vice-President Marinho ' s ideas and , I believe , they are seconded by the whole of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
The first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance , and that they should be given one more référendaire .
The second is that the translation services of the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice should be separated .
At the moment , the Court of First Instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated .
Since we are talking about the Intergovernmental Conference , let us consider just two points .
The first concerns this Parliament .
I believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the Court of Justice , even in the appointment of judges .
Above all , we wish to see an extension of the competences of the Court of Justice , hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations , in other words , its resources .
And I refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report .
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency .
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice .
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT .
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy .
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age .
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe ' s system of justice .
Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy .
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court .
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references .
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff , rather of the Court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union .
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning .
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system .
Otherwise we will all , as elected representatives , be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .
I also fully endorse his findings , in which , in particular , he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service .
However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here .
I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission ' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level .
It seems to me that we need to give this some thought , as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions .
We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind .
Where possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance .
On a final note , I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law .
As things stand , OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases .
It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court .
The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance .
That would be another way of spurring the reform process on .
Mr President , I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work .
The European Union is a system based on law .
It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law .
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem .
However , as Mr Marinho has pointed out , more is necessary , but that has to wait for the IGC ,
In my own country , mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges .
There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system .
This has been compounded , so some who advise me believe , by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government .
Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible .
This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable .
What is happening in France , Mr President , appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties .
I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this .
Mr President , on behalf of Commission President , Mr Prodi , I would like to respond as follows .
The unease is justified .
It has been said more than once : justice delayed is justice denied .
The Commission sympathises with these considerations . In the light of this sympathy , I would like to continue my response as follows .
In other words , once this study is complete , the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo
I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes .
I propose that we start the debate immediately .
He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives .
I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges , in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
An urgent request has been referred to us , and we approve it .
We have been asked for EUR 35 million .
There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration .
This is not our opinion .
Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region .
Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state .
The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments , the donors have made commitments and , obviously , we are the only ones actually paying .
The other parties are not paying .
We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid .
We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this .
We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors .
This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but , quite the contrary , to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors .
From that point of view , the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest .
Finally , we have three questions for the Commission in this regard . Firstly , we need the Commission to give us , on a regular basis , the list and the amounts that other donors contribute .
When we come to pay , we want to know what the others are paying .
Secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation .
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet , according to our information , no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date .
This is serious , since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo .
Finally , and this follows on from what I have just said , we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regarding progress on payments made .
We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments .
It is not firm commitments that we need , just plain commitments would suffice , and we need to know what has actually been paid and , more especially , what has not been paid .
Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment .
No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result .
No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK .
In other words , there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either .
Of all people , it is the Albanians , who are now being integrated into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them .
I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about .
Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors .
That is excellent news !
It should also be noted that of the 19 departments , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto .
There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law .
Another positive development I would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UCK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country .
I believe that is a good thing
The EU Commission cannot pay for everything .
It is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the Fourth Pillar , but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay Mr Kouchner ' s outstanding bills .
We have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it .
Mr President , I would like to offer a few explanations .
In a debate , there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said .
However , I would like to concentrate on two points .
Firstly , I would like to make it very clear that the Union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo .
I would like to point out to Mrs Albright that what we have read recently in the press is true , and that figures do not lie .
Let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .
I would like to say to Mrs Pack that I am in complete agreement with her when she says that the Commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments .
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , please excuse my late arrival , but this other political issue is still on the agenda today , more is the pity .
The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there .
However , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process .
Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents .
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions .
I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future .
It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this .
However , we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here .
Secondly , even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there , we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into .
This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations .
It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe , in the interests of the persons affected .
This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence .
We have so many coordinators , who , in turn , are responsible to so many employers , that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators .
It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground !
If the Alliance is still active in that region , it is with the same objective .
We must work to ensure that , in this province and indeed throughout the Balkans generally , the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords .
It is true that economic aid is , in this respect , certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Brok , for his report .
If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on .
The Council ' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret .
What is to be done with this money ?
I would like to highlight the issue of human rights .
The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today ?
Every single day there are attacks on Serbs , on the Roma , on Bosnians , but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians .
These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated .
I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo .
There are , at the very least , rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again .
It is irrelevant , as far as I am concerned , as to whether it is Serbs , Roma , Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo .
It is also irrelevant , in my view , as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo .
What is all-important , to my mind , is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is , a Kosovo where people can live together .
We need more police officers , as we have nowhere near enough .
We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights .
All of this needs to happen , and quickly too .
If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise .
That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available .
.
( ES ) Mr President , I would like firstly to thank the Members , and especially the rapporteur , for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue .
This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned .
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate .
Firstly , although much progress has been made , and we could mention customs administration , bank administration or tax administration , it is true that we must continue to move forward .
However , in moving forward , what should we be financing ?
This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement .
In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds , for example , Amendments Nos 3 and 5 .
In our view , however , in both respects , greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which , on the ground , is more aware of the reality than we are .
We believe that to prejudge , at the moment , where resources should be directed , would create more practical difficulties .
In short , we should put our faith in those parties who , in these areas , are better equipped than us to make certain decisions .
Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate ?
Some of the amendments in your report pose this question .
For example , Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 4 .
I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue , that this is not the fundamental problem , although we recognise it totally .
I would say the same about Amendment No 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seems to us to be basically correct .
Amendment No 4 is of a similar nature . On this specific point , we can perhaps offer Mr Bourlanges greater satisfaction .
We have already spoken to the Council so that it might include a Commission statement in its decision , establishing this element of conditionality .
A third problem has been raised by Mrs Dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes .
I would remind you that these projects are multiannual .
The programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account .
Lastly , I would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us .
The Commission can commit itself to regularly informing Parliament of the invitations to tender which are published .
We also wish to see these publicised on the Internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point .
A second point which I would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to Parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance .
I do , however , have one small concern , when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets .
But , if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly , then this undertaking was only a tentative one .
Commissioner , an agreement is an agreement .
Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets , yes or no ? Or are you going to drop this proviso , thus breaking the undertaking made to us ?
No , Mr Bourlanges , I think it is a substantive problem .
The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .
What I proposed to you , and what I still say , is that the Commission will make a statement , in the Council Decision , something like this :
The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo ' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors .
With this , we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed .
I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche .
I agree , absolutely . We shall do so .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
ALTENER
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council .
The project has been long and problematic .
In future too , there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources .
Although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects .
One example is the use of peat .
Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels .
If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable , non-fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned .
It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as , for example , coal .
The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union ' s dependence on imported energy .
Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU ' s next round of enlargement .
Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries , whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy .
The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate .
We are all concerned about the environment and our children ' s future .
The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased , but it has to be done in a rational manner .
We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come .
For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate : nuclear energy .
Mr President , on behalf of the PSE Group , I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme .
Firstly , however , I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Langen , for the truly excellent work he has done on this report .
I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee , Mr Provan .
For as Mr Langen said just now , we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee .
However , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout .
This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear .
However , we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed .
For in the course of the next few years , the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double , accounting for at least 12 % of energy consumption .
This is the European Union ' s declared aim .
That being the case , since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources , it will certainly be have a key role .
In the first place , this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme .
We now have available to us a working paper from the Commission ' s services on a breakthrough campaign , which is in fact a crucial element of this Community strategy .
It contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors .
It is very important for this ALTENER programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it .
The overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion .
75 % -80 % of this is to come from private sources , and this will be supplemented by public funds from the Member States and from the regions .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank Mr Langen for his excellent work in this important matter .
The conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the Altener programme as put forward by the Conciliation Committee is , after all the difficult phases it has been through , at least satisfactory .
Most of Parliament ' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive .
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy .
There is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets , however .
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects , research , information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy .
The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the Member States .
This programme will hopefully encourage Member States to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy .
However , in the future , the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market .
Promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment .
The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up .
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness .
Europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy .
We should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment .
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat ?
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources .
However , it is important , at least in Finland , as a sustainably used , slowly renewable energy source .
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables .
It is interesting for me , as a new Member of Parliament , to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation .
This is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale .
In contrast with that , I see the amounts allocated for renewable energies , which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion .
In order to ensure that at least 50 % of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources , it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term .
Mr President , may I commence by complimenting Mr Langen on his work .
The activities of the ALTENER programme will promote renewable energy sources and I believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future .
For this reason , I am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises .
The internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone . In this regard , it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit .
It is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables .
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £ 125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector .
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives .
As the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities .
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster , a significant portion of which falls within Ireland ' s only Objective I region .
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector .
In short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the Kyoto Protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies .
ALTENER will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the Member States .
Mr President , Mr Langen , ladies and gentlemen , as our rapporteur mentioned , we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the Council on the ALTENER programme .
Mr Langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the Council was initially FF 74 million , whereas the Commission proposed 81.1 million , a figure which the European Parliament supported .
An initial conciliation meeting was not successful , because the Council would not at that time accept an increase of EUR 1.9 million .
We could not agree with a proposal like this , which challenged the authority of the European Parliament .
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million .
In fact , renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives .
This programme , together with the SAVE II programme , integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy , establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence .
And I shall end , of course , by congratulating Mr Langen , our rapporteur , on his work , as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee .
.
All of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes , into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme , which we will be discussing soon .
I would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the Council .
SAVE
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round , which is not always the case .
I am happy to say that I can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for Parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form .
The financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the Council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there .
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading .
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re-instatement of the Commission ' s original budget .
The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable .
During the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise , implement , complement and assess the Community measures .
Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency .
I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .
The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council ' s very meagre opening offer .
In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount .
This was an important consideration for us .
I would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real .
Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States .
We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme .
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region .
We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard .
SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy .
It focuses on non-technical elements , helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted .
Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings .
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business , saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical .
It is something that we can all support .
We could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports .
We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see .
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change .
If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do .
I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process .
This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds , as we said at the time , and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament ' s prerogatives and competences .
From the point of view of the Commission , in this interinstitutional game , I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
CULTURE 2000
Madam President , I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate .
Unfortunately , there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it .
We have the feeling , and are in fact convinced , that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht .
For no one is very keen to spend money on culture .
Sadly that is the case and we must face facts .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task , in conjunction with the Commissioner of course .
We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content , of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect .
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision .
What kind of horse-trading system is this ? Certainly not a fair one !
There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side , begging for a little more money for culture .
It is downright scandalous what goes on !
It is an awful sort of horse-trading , based on unequal positions !
Nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .
It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us .
If one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied , but then only a tiny bit .
It is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money .
Madam President , I agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and I must add that , during the conciliation procedure , I was personally a little disappointed with the Council .
On the other hand , it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this Parliament , which were minimal anyway .
Incidentally , this last point would be unfair to fourteen Members of the Council , since it was just one , the Netherlands , which was responsible for that intransigence .
It has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the Council .
This demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution .
By taking action in the field of culture , we are directly contributing to the construction of a European soul , especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up " Culture 2000 " are superb .
In recent years , these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the European Union .
Congratulations !
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , I would like to start by thanking Mr Graça Moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this Culture 2000 programme .
It is also of great importance to citizens .
We should , above all , not lose sight of this .
Today , we have arrived at the end of a long road .
I would nonetheless like , as others have done , to touch upon the procedure , which is unclear and , above all , unwanted .
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand .
They are like a snake biting its own tail .
There is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand : anything is open for discussion , as long as the budget stays fixed .
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage .
The result is 30 % growth , so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result .
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot .
Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas .
A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds , and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind .
Fortunately , I am on the Committee on Regional Policy . So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention .
I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because , if it happens to be cancelled , then surely this does not benefit the citizen .
I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect .
However , I do think that it is necessary , as he always states too , that , in the next IGC , changes will be made to codecision , when unanimity will no longer be necessary .
This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas . I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000 .
All that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .
I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart .
It is shameful !
That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union !
We hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process .
We sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action , among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social , as well as economic , development of a people .
Both of them have done a first-class job .
Why do I say that culture is important ?
Well in simple economic terms , Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity .
Where would Europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?
But , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised .
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs ; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy .
Cultural diversity is important , and it is under threat .
However , it is not under threat from Europe .
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven ' s sake .
We do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish saunas , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat .
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola , eating hamburgers , wearing baseball caps , watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time .
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe ' s culture , but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can .
That is what Culture 2000 is about .
So , I say to the Council of Ministers : Keep this programme genuinely under review .
Are we doing enough ?
And , I say to Madame Reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side .
Madam President , I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , Graa Moura , and Commissioner Reding , for their contribution to the creation of this programme .
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council .
The outcome can be considered reasonable , when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council .
We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture .
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council .
The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael programmes .
When implementation of the programme begins , I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full .
I believe and hope that , despite the assault on us all of the new technology , literature will maintain its status .
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial .
Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage , increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues .
I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society .
Madam President , Commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , somehow or other , today ' s agenda has come full circle .
Youth , education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values , for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes .
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union ' s goals .
Cultural activity creates identity .
Cultural activity is an expression of individuality , of an individual ' s own personality ; it builds relationships and communicates .
We want a colourful Europe .
We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity .
We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences .
That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget , the allocation of funds that is , into the different types of measure .
That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures , because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals ; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom .
I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say .
Madam President , as we have heard , all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council .
It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture ' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests .
In this way , the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order .
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years , and now , at long last , the European Parliament can give the go-ahead .
The Council could not be moved , not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael finished .
A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap .
This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union ' s cultural policy activities once again .
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support .
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered .
The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro !
And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004 .
That is the same as a single , medium-sized , German opera house ' s expenditure over the same period , when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years !
There is a blatant discrepancy here !
And so we are going to have to be content , albeit very grudgingly , with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content .
Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out .
We can only hope that it will , after all , be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day .
Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good , not harm !
Cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be .
Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance , and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions .
What , may I ask , is the Council afraid of ?
I have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at European organisational level has been firmly asserted , but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the European States will make .
I shall simply stress my own personal complaint because , in the end , we did not manage to adopt a review clause .
However , Mrs Reding was certainly receptive and farsighted , and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years , and therefore to change the situation .
This is not rhetoric , but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the European States and constitutes a turning point for the European Parliament and the Commission .
Man and culture are priorities , and culture can result in economic growth .
Let us contemplate this result , derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy .
Madam President , may I first thank Mr Graça Moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry .
It seems to me when entering the conciliation process for Culture 2000 , having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate .
The fundamental question , it seems to me , that faces this Parliament , the Commission and the Council is : What is Europe ?
What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries ?
That is what Culture 2000 represents .
It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century , an identity which eschews the echoes of division , of war , of poverty , of opportunity , of poverty dans la realité .
It promotes mobility , and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded .
My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we have now come to the end of a long road .
Following the conciliation stage , our institutions can now formally adopt the new ' Culture 2000 ' framework programme .
We shall thus , in the course of the next five years , have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear , well-structured and , I am sure , successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector .
It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this ' happy ending ' in this House , and I thank you for it .
I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process .
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution .
Throughout the negotiations , they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time .
If need be , the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision , and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002 .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is a formal commitment , not just words on paper .
It is thanks , too , to Parliament ' s action , preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens ' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale .
This is going to lead us to make ' Culture 2000 ' the programme of the citizen .
The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for .
I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality .
This is what our European ' Culture 2000 ' programme offers .
It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States . Such policies are necessary , and I would like to see them developed further .
It simply adds to them , complements them , building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries .
A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point . If the Union is purely an economic union , then it is a stillborn project .
However , if it is a union of culture , civilisation and participation , then it becomes a living thing .
Secondly , encouraging exchanges , mobility and training in the cultural sector .
Thirdly , promoting cooperation between cultural operators .
The new programme will , I am sure , in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures .
Madam President , I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for , once again , having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union .
Thank you , Commissioner . I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow .
( The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m. )
End-of-life vehicles
Mr President , nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe .
It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed .
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking .
We therefore have a number of amendments .
I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective .
I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive .
Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included , as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area .
I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either .
I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas .
This is my main concern in this matter .
In my opinion , the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe .
This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars .
This will involve , for example , disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil , removing break fluid , etc .
An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts .
What should we do with the shredded products ?
We should not overlook the fact that , although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery , they are by no means the only point .
Do not forget that , in the case of cars , 80 % of environmental impact comes through driving , 1 % through recovery and 19 % through construction .
Quotas are not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many .
Of course we need to aim high , but quotas must not become an end in themselves .
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars .
This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation .
This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which , if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol , is the important factor .
We therefore consider that , in future , vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas .
It should not be for each Member State , but for you and your staff , Commissioner , to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles ( and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles ) should receive preferential treatment .
We think they should .
May I say something about costs .
Some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers ; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer .
However , this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling .
I can only warn you against consenting to this .
There are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car .
The money from this pool , system , or however you want to picture it , would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder .
This too is a particular desire of my group .
Our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage , namely that we won 't be an immediate candidate for the Court of Justice when the directive is adopted .
The car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions , which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly .
This is why I propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer .
As for a ban on certain materials : of course we need one !
A car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term .
This means that we need a pressure instrument .
The Commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives .
There are a number of sound amendments .
This Parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it !
Let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive .
A directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this House .
I ask for your support .
The principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied .
Vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by Community legislation , in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles .
The only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future .
It has not , however , been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle .
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives , including the one on auto-oil , which we voted on a few years ago .
Once again , the principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied . The taxpayer is still footing the bill .
Neither is correct .
We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive .
It means ecological progress for Europe , and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion .
All the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict .
In the grand scheme of the directive , it is perhaps a minor point , but nevertheless a disputed one .
It concerns the issue of recycling costs .
Last February in this House we unambiguously decided ( and we Social Democrats are sticking to this ) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question !
So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of ?
For us this is straightforward : in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars .
And what about vehicles which are already on the road ?
Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection ; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe .
Consequently , for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs .
However , I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe , so that these jobs can be secured in the future .
I am in favour of stringent environmental requirements , as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions , but I believe that they should be the same for everyone !
Mr President , Commissioner , I think we need this directive .
Firstly , because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives .
Secondly , because it can promote recycling , which is important .
Thirdly , because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals .
This is also an important point .
The directive affords a European framework , also to Member States who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these .
Secondly , we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position .
As from 2006 , therefore , all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners .
Needless to say , this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way .
Is this too much of a burden ? There is , however , one thing we should not overlook .
The directive applies to complete cars , that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing . According to the experts , few of these complete cars are of no value .
After all , recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making .
Quite the reverse , in fact . At present , there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them , and a decent one at that .
This directive encourages the whole of this sector . It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses .
I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles , and I think we ought to add this provision to it .
I think , therefore , that vintage cars ought to be exempt .
Also , it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer . That is a basic principle which we must uphold .
As manufacturers are responsible for the design , they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase .
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer , as stipulated in the common position .
I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things .
I think we need to retain it .
This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence .
After all , we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about , and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position .
In my opinion , we should not jeopardise that common position , because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons .
I would ask you to support this common position .
Mr President , we need to take an important decision today .
Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer ' s liability , that is to say that cars , once they have reached the end of their lives , are the responsibility of the car manufacturer ?
No , according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38 : car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50 / 50 .
It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50 / 50 compromise is included that this does not work .
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment .
Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say : yes , we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45 .
The common position stipulates 2006 . According to the group of the Greens , this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations .
I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists .
If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars , they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply .
The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic . This is ultimately cheaper , also for the consumer .
For twenty years , the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener .
Today , this green position is being threatened under pressure from , in particular , the German and French car industries .
That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45 .
We , the Green Group , by and large support the common position .
Mr President , the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances .
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area .
With this directive , we have the chance to take a big step forward , but this presupposes that the Council ' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament ' s reading of it .
If they were adopted , many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive .
This applies , above all , to amendments from the Group of the European People ' s Party but also , unfortunately , to some of the amendments from Mr Lange , as I see it .
It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries , for example in Germany , went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted .
For ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .
The polluter should pay .
This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility , financial as well as otherwise , for recycling vehicles .
There must be rules governing existing vehicles too .
Where this aspect is concerned , we cannot accept any weakening of the Council ' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force .
There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years , and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead .
We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations .
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive , this would be very detrimental , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament ' s credibility on environmental issues .
I was myself a car worker before I was elected . I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars .
I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry . These would , of course , be to the advantage of modern , progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms .
It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union .
Mr President , I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe .
There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment .
Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests .
Each year , there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union .
This in itself generates a large amount of waste .
We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union .
Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years .
In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information .
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year .
Mr President , the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe .
I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials , a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation .
In this regard , we are certainly on the right track , but as some Members have already stressed , the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers ' responsibility will become a shared responsibility .
We need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter .
Mr President , this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life .
To that extent , it might be thought desirable , even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity .
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year ?
Who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made ?
The proposal from the Council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot .
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union .
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars .
I commend Mr Florenz , Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs .
I also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from Germany , Italy , Ireland , Spain , Sweden and Britain , to remove the retrospective nature of this measure .
Retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law .
Most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case .
That is why I have called for a roll-call vote on this .
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry .
The Council ' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all , or a significant part , of the costs of recovery and recycling .
But , as Mr Lange so rightly said , this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers .
This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs .
The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market .
I think we would all agree on that . Having said that , one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12 , i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force .
Parliament ' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive ' s entry into force , for new vehicles , is not terribly realistic .
The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling .
The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road .
This would , furthermore , make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses .
Like my group , I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which , I feel , offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection .
Mr President , the European Parliament is today facing an important decision .
The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake .
It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection !
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious : to sabotage the directive !
The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation .
This is totally unacceptable .
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today !
The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive .
Do not continue in this vein !
The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry .
Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers !
Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry !
Mr President , this directive has been under discussion since 1997 .
It is high time that we reached an agreement .
Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed , not only in the case of lead , cadmium and mercury , but also in the case of waste which contains PVC .
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context .
The other question is who should bear the cost .
I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay , and this proposal expresses that idea very well .
Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006 , as some of the amendments propose .
We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading .
It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials .
I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines .
Mr President , today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities . We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year .
I come , of course , from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries .
I can gauge its importance for my country ' s international reputation .
I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles .
I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise .
That is why , today , we must be understanding alchemists , concerned for our environment . This will either be the century of waste management or it will not .
As far as I am concerned , at least , the principle of ' polluter pays ' must be applied .
The car industry , increasingly more respectful of the environment , has , I am sure , anticipated this kind of increasing awareness .
Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities .
I am opposed to making the car owners liable .
It would certainly be unwise for my fellow Members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the European Parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer .
How , furthermore , can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within Europe .
Who is to pay for recycling the car I bought in France if I register it in Belgium ?
Which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle ?
Let us beware , too , of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application .
It is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today , but to continue on our present course , advocating sustainable development .
Now , a sound common position submitted by the Council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in Parliament .
Every year , we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances .
This is why it is important to prevent waste materials .
We should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals , as well as of other dangerous substances and materials .
In addition , car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use .
What is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately .
I therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the Council .
These days , the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable . This means that we move away from shredding .
The prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and , in the Netherlands , a value of 86 % recycling has now already been achieved .
The best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and / or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost .
The processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars .
The proposals made by a few MEPs impact greatly on this system .
The so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation .
If the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied , it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably .
Finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .
A laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay , at the expense of the environment .
Why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled ?
If we are , then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the Council on the result achieved .
Mr President , I hold Mr Florenz in high esteem .
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry .
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and , against that background , find a compromise . That was not easy .
Overall , I am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position . I would like to comment on two things .
I do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way .
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and / or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost .
In my opinion , there is too much initial hesitation .
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path .
I would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on .
These costs are not very high .
In the Member State where I come from , you are talking about 150 Guilders per car .
If you charge this from day one , you can process the old cars straight away .
A very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards , which used to be a common feature in our Member States , would then disappear .
I do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise .
I think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible .
This is positive because , in that way , the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto European roads will actually be processed appropriately , and this will benefit us all .
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers ' liability .
If we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste .
If these amendments are adopted , I think that we shall cause Parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues .
I would therefore recommend to Members of Parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers ' liability .
We shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result .
Mr President , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled .
Now who should pay the costs ?
Whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer .
The best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars .
The manufacturers have tricked Mr Florenz and Mr Lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals .
Do not be fooled by the car manufacturers !
If you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments .
Mr President , Commissioner , this debate is not a technical debate , contrary to what we may think .
It has become eminently political .
Yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate .
Today , if 314 Members of Parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers , we should be doing ourselves dishonour .
We cannot accept this . It would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas .
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would be weakening a Council position , whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough .
The free recovery system , for example , for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly .
Mr President , like so many others here today , I believe this is a good measure .
This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need .
Most of the technical issues have been resolved .
There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved .
We have arrived at the final question .
In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament .
That is quite simply : Who pays ?
The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said .
In fact perhaps as little , the lawyers tell us , as 20 % or one-fifth of the cost .
That is not unreasonable .
They have paid already .
Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers , pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from ?
I cannot accept that .
There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case .
I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it .
The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer .
It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal .
The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government .
The common position is a reasonable compromise .
Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road .
I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments .
It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter .
Mind you , even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved .
It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises .
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector .
The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs .
The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint .
Consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars .
The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation .
However , the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these .
Mr President , we are indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position .
In contrast to what the previous speaker said , I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values .
That is why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility .
Mr President , there are two issues of principle in the Council ' s draft directive .
The first concerns the manufacturer ' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles .
There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade . This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles .
I believe that , quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned , the EU ' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly .
Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears , for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts .
Yet the trade in used car parts is important , especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles .
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy .
It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up .
They should be able to establish themselves in new markets , but also to leave old markets .
To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development .
The second principle in the Council ' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive .
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product .
To do so also changes the owner ' s liability retroactively . Over the years , a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways .
Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars .
Some may be better than others , and some worse .
In anticipation of this EU directive ' s being implemented , EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied .
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds .
Mr President , everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question .
The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement , and puts the whole directive at risk .
I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument .
I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive ; the costs are not excessive : recycling a car costs less than 1 % of the price of a new car .
Mr President , this is an extremely bad directive .
First of all , as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out , it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle .
Secondly , it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment .
In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment .
I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect , which has not been examined well enough in this debate .
It is like so much European legislation .
It is far too prescriptive .
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling .
One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars .
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so .
There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars , recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts .
This is a very environmentally reasonable approach .
It is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery .
Mr President , the common position is sound , but it is up to Parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles .
The Social-Democratic Group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days .
For the cars currently on the road , it would be reasonable to share the cost , for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands .
The common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end-of-life vehicles .
This is a big problem in my opinion .
I urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles , as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market .
They would then determine their own prices .
Anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic .
The European consumer organisation , which has asked us to support the common position on this point , is to my mind letting the consumer down .
A second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers ' clutches is the cost of transport .
If car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies , this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances .
This is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either .
I would therefore appreciate your support for Amendment No 45 .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate .
If you travel to the Netherlands , you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free .
This is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes .
Should this be condemned ecologically , Frau Breyer ?
I do not think so .
( Applause from the PSE Group )
I think we have tabled a sound proposal .
The main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer , the vendor , or whoever , should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost .
I will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems .
We have reached an agreement with all the parties involved . These include car manufacturers , second-hand car dealers , the federation of the car industry , the metal processing firms , shredding firms and the government .
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis .
The car industry - and Belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that .
Belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost .
Some businesses have become hi-tech businesses , because they managed to recycle certain materials , even materials which are not yet included in the directive .
So this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain .
I am in favour of collection free of charge .
It worked for us .
Why would it not work elsewhere ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented .
Would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes .
Allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive .
Allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate .
First of all , I think I should repeat some of the basic facts which Mr Florenz and others have already mentioned .
What we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the European Union , resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste .
This means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars , and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open .
Moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind .
Approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars , but also cadmium , chromium , mercury and other very dangerous substances .
This is something you already know , but I would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening .
Cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in Europe .
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it , and there is no excuse for not taking action .
The present directive has three aims .
First of all , we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars .
Secondly , we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable .
We can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product ' s life-cycle . Instead , we should avoid creating so much waste .
We should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product .
Thirdly , we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive .
These are the three most important aims of the directive .
This is , of course , because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled .
It is , above all , the manufacturer ' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car ' s life-cycle .
Two important questions have arisen in this regard . Yes , there are in fact more than two questions , but I want to mention just two of the most important .
First of all : who should pay ?
And secondly : are we reducing the European car industry ' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal ?
The first question , then , is about who should pay .
It is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers .
We have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car .
Do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ? No .
Clearly , we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment , but it will be very much greater .
Moreover , the cost will have to be borne in the future .
The cost will not therefore disappear , but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed .
Are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis ?
Is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it ?
Is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these ?
Is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the European car industry ?
No , of course not .
It is quite the opposite . Do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future ?
What kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars ?
Naturally , that they should be environmentally friendly , that they should be recyclable , that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment .
It is , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry .
The cost is not insurmountable ; nor is the task an impossible one .
The industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in Europe .
They will not represent an insurmountable cost for the European car industry .
They will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars .
We must do this for the sake of the environment .
The costs will not disappear . Nor will the waste disappear .
But , otherwise , we must all of us , as taxpayers or citizens , foot the bill . What is more , the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action .
That is what I should like to say by way of introduction .
I also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation .
Clearly , we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars . It is still not an insurmountable problem .
We can deal with it .
We already have an infrastructure . We have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars .
I naturally hope that the result of today ' s vote will be a good one .
I believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment .
We cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters . As I have said , we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues .
After the first reading in the European Parliament in 1999 , the Commission ' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the Council .
However , we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency .
Now , we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully .
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled .
The Commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety .
Amendments Nos 6 and 21 are new ; the Commission can approve these .
The Commission can also approve Amendment No 26 with certain editorial changes .
Parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in Europe . It would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today .
I am very concerned about certain amendments from Parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question .
These concern , for example , the phasing-out of heavy metals , manufacturer ' s liability and the requirement for recycling .
I want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis .
Amendments Nos 4 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 concern the phasing-out of heavy metals .
Amendment No 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force .
Amendments Nos 13 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions . This would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly .
Amendments Nos 4 , 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling .
The Commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view .
Amendments Nos 17 , 18 , 27 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer ' s liability .
The compromise reached by the Council is fair but fragile . The Commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without , at the same time , creating tensions .
I regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the Commission being wrongly used , so creating uncertainty about the Commission ' s attitude to the issue .
I want to emphasise that , as early as 1997 , the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer ' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position .
This does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers . Far from it .
Amendments Nos 39 , 40 , 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives .
The high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed .
These amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise .
Such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive .
So , whatever has been stated in this regard , vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive .
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive .
Amendment No 23 involves the Commission ' s having to adopt quality standards for reusable components .
This is not covered by the directive .
An ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the European Parliament and the Council .
Amendments Nos 29 , 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles .
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic , tyres and glass .
Finally , the Commission cannot approve Amendments Nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity ; nor Amendment No 19 , which the Commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage .
Furthermore , Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applicability .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The debate is closed .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Vote
Madam President , as you know , the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors , particularly in the French version .
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently .
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4 .
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations . In the French version that becomes ' entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques ' .
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct .
It should not be in the amendment .
And , again , I urge you , Madam President , to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently .
Madam President , I would simply like to point out that during the procedure , we were not allowed either to table or , consequently , adopt amendments in the Committee .
I do not know whether this is in order , and I would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the House .
I have taken note of your comment , Mr Speroni .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria
Madam President , we simply have a few translation problems in this area too .
We consider the English version to be the original text .
To give you an example , in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Dutch and German versions , the equivalents of the English words : " in so far as " have been omitted .
This is why I would ask you to consider the English version as the original version .
Thank you , Mr van Velzen .
In response I shall say the same thing I said to Mrs McNally just now .
I am very concerned about these translation problems which , unfortunately , we seem to be having increasingly , and I can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed .
In any case , the authoritative version is always , of course , the original language version .
- ( FR ) I am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the Commission entitled ' Women and Science ' .
In this document , the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe .
This objective deserves our total support .
Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union , after agriculture and the Structural Funds .
The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States .
Relatively few women , however , are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies .
It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented .
I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission .
The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level , especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , which is quite obviously something I approve of .
Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles .
We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy .
In its communication " Women and Science " , the European Commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in Europe .
This is very good , and we are pleased to see it .
The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union .
This is patently not the case , since such a quota would not be realistic .
Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved .
It is not a quota ! It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission , insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States .
The latter would be well advised , however , to follow the good example of the Commission , for once , and make the same efforts in their own research programmes .
People must realise this !
Second reading of the Florenz report ( A5-0006 / 2000 )
Madam President , today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the Directive on end-of-life vehicles .
I have rejected the entire directive , not least because Amendment No 34 to Article 12 and the amendments to Article 5 / 4 have not received an adequate majority here in the House .
I come from a country which manufactures 50 % of the cars in the EU and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable .
Here , in my opinion , the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies .
This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment .
I consider that this is a serious defect and that , in principle , it does not befit our legal system .
In my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason .
Madam President , I would like to comment on the Florenz report .
Unfortunately , there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy , i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years .
We know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made .
Here , unfortunately , the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry .
These splendid cars do not constitute waste .
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments .
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country ' s statutes to another ' s .
In this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations .
We cannot forget old car enthusiasts either , of whom there are more than 50 000 in Finland alone .
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance .
- ( SV ) The parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing , to say the least .
Before the vote at the plenary sitting , new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the Committee .
In the divided situation which has now arisen , we therefore consider that the Council ' s wordings are the best .
We need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure .
The directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation .
It is therefore important that the manufacturer ' s liability should be clear . This should not in any way be jeopardised .
Today , Parliament is examining , for the last time , this text on ' end-of-life ' vehicles and what is to be done with them : their destruction , a commendable intention with regard to our environment .
There are , however , two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text .
First of all , who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction ?
We must all ensure that it is not always the same person , i.e. the vehicle owner , who pays .
He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle , which is a bottomless pit in financial terms .
We have recently had cause to talk about the ' polluter pays ' principle .
We should apply this principle rationally and calmly , correctly targeted and without ideology .
Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope .
So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry .
These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe , if we are not to water down each of our specific identities .
There is no lack of examples amongst European texts , and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision .
I only need to mention the case of Directives 79 / 409 and 92 / 43 .
The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis .
It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena .
That would not be fulfilling our mission .
On the contrary , we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes .
.
( NL ) That the Florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement .
I regret that the manufacturers have harangued the European Parliament and the Council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false .
I dare say this because I took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from , among others , scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully .
They made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety , for example , are nonsense .
The car lobby was unsuccessful today and I am pleased about that .
The directive remains in place .
I expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements .
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments .
There are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution .
However , there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives .
When it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good .
In fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good .
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut .
No one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged , but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity .
Of course , these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction .
However , in the absence of these powers , it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure .
Instead , it should leave Member States to develop their own systems , and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good .
Berger Report ( A5-0007 / 2000 )
Until now , the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh .
It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier , even when they are nationals of third countries .
This means that this proposal ' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers , but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services .
Berger Report ( A5-0007 / 2000 ) and Berger Report ( A5-0012 / 2000 )
It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services .
The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there .
According to the terms of the directive , the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned .
Logically , in order to be given such a card , the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme .
The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals .
While , basically , I subscribe to the European Commission proposals , nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion .
That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur . This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading !
Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures , for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards .
I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions .
This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union .
Marinho Report ( A5-0003 / 2000 ) :
We have serious reservations about the Council ' s proposed amendments .
How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched ?
The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter .
Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim , but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them :
On 1 January 1995 , the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994 .
So what was done at Amsterdam ?
In that respect , nothing . On the contrary , extending the Community ' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden .
You will agree , furthermore , that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction , and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up .
Consequently , these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake . They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred .
We cannot agree to this , since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States .
The time has come , we feel , for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice .
This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity .
Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this ?
Dimitrakopoulos and Leinen Report ( A5-0018 / 2000 )
- ( SV ) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .
We therefore , of course , support the European Parliament ' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .
We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place .
We also argued this in November 1999 , and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 .
. ( FR ) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference , the European Parliament calls for a " constitutional process to be launched " .
This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is really a closet constitution .
It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria .
The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference .
Incidentally , the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament .
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions .
If they yield , they are lost . For it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one .
.
( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference .
We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December .
An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process .
That is something we do not want to see , and we have therefore voted against any such extension .
We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding .
.
( SV ) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference .
Possible future Member States ought to be involved in , and have an influence upon , the shaping of the EU of the future .
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels .
With the convening of the forthcoming IGC , the process of European Union is topical once again .
It is therefore easy to understand the public ' s lack of interest , given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them .
In fact , one only need look at the agenda of the IGC : the institutions , enlargement and European defence .
Social Europe , used as a foil by the EU , has simply been eliminated from the agenda .
All this does is to legitimise the development , on the European scale , of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers ' main claims towards the highest common denominator .
This is why I am voting against the report .
As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated , the Union has the right to protect itself .
I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda , and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties .
We feel that these issues result from the IGC ' s appropriateness and its objectives , as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there .
We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged .
These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us .
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report .
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions .
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation .
The key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties .
In our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are .
Our priorities ( i.e. the " left-overs " ) must be :
the number and responsibilities of Commissioners
weighting of votes in the Council
extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe ( but not Treaty change , defence matters , border controls or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended
Beyond this , we have concerns that the " flexibility " or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present .
The most important task of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States .
I therefore , of course , support the European Parliament ' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference .
I nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place .
I also refer to my explanation of vote of 18 November 1999 which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence .
Joint resolution on Austria
This PPE / DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott .
Whatever Jörg Haider ' s verbal excesses , which we of course deplore , the Austrians have made a democratic choice , and we must respect this .
Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever , it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE / DE Members of Parliament .
In order to prevent this threat to the system , it is ready to do anything , including overruling the outcome of free elections , including setting up a thought police , including establishing a new form of totalitarianism .
Is this hysteria spontaneous ?
Is it the product of mere foolishness or , more probably , of a deliberate strategy , which is the same throughout the world ?
Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe , daring to stop them choosing their own fate ?
Underground networks ?
The government of the United States , or of Israel ?
Or their Socialist back-up troops who , in this House , have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats ?
What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party , which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals , via Vandam and Agusta ?
What are the values of the French Socialist Party , which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba , Sages and Graco scandals ?
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party , because it does not do to kick a man when he is down , still less when he is dead and gone .
I shall , however , mention the Spanish Socialist Party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of Albacete and which settled its accounts with Basque nationalists by hiring contract killers .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Madam President , I had a major problem with this resolution . Finally , I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons .
However , I do wonder about the wisdom of this .
Firstly , there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that .
I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there .
At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments .
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations .
We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it .
I really think that people should be extremely cautious .
If you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and I believe that we should , we need to look at the root causes .
We need to look at the people who vote for these parties , and understand why this situation arises .
Madam President , I strongly refute any statement , demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism .
I passionately defend Europe ' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law .
I disagree , however , for this very reason , with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States .
This is not the way to fight extremism .
It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good .
What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference ?
A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14 , or even fewer ?
This needs to be said !
Madam President , I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has , by an enormous majority , condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider ' s Freedom Party .
Mr Haider has demonstrated , over the past years by both words and deeds , that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse .
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler , praised the Waffen SS , and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma , but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government .
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria ' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants .
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics .
They are wrong .
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights .
Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections .
However , democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy .
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust , the death of 6 million Jews , to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s .
However , we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition .
Leopards do not change their spots .
The real culprits are Austria ' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945 .
These are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .
This European Parliament requires the European Commission to be vigilant of any racist action in Austria , and threatens to suspend Austria from membership of the European Union if this happens .
I am proud to support such a resolution .
I shall take the floor very briefly , Madam President .
I respect Parliament ' s wish , as it has been expressed , but I must also say that the self-determination of peoples cannot be called into question , even by the European Parliament .
The document is unfair both to Austrian Members of the European Parliament , and to members of the Austrian national parliament , and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests , but also of business .
I do not believe that these signals will change the citizens ' indifference to Europe .
The Austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present .
I very much welcome the position taken by the Italian Radicals ; and I say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between Italian liberals and Austrian liberals .
I have for many years , in word and deed , been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia .
I have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though I agree with many of its premises .
What we have here , first and foremost , is an incredibly ominous mixture of power , arrogance and impotence on the part of the European Union .
Not only do these decisions conflict with the Treaty and apportion to the institutions of the Union more power than that to which they are entitled but , worst of all , their effect will be counter-productive .
They will not weaken Mr Haider and the FPÖ . On the contrary , they will strengthen them .
We shall obtain the very opposite of what we want .
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right .
.
( DA ) The Left ' s Members of the European Parliament attach importance to the fact that , with today ' s decision , Parliament has NOT supported the fourteen prime ministers ' diplomatic sanctions against Austria .
The Left ' s Members of Parliament therefore supported the Liberal decision ' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in Austria or elsewhere .
- ( EL ) The Freedom Party ' s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union ' s political future .
It is a ' Trojan horse ' which is unfortunately reappearing in Europe larger than ever since the Second World War .
The European Parliament and the Union ' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes admirers of Nazism and advocates of xenophobia .
We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms , in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery .
Our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution , their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious .
This week we heard the first political cry of the new-born Europe .
It is a part of its future which is at stake right now , part of its very essence , its heart and soul .
The European Parliament was the first to speak up .
This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe .
Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events .
The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today , before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow .
From now on Europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition .
I am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the European Parliament , after its excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a stance on this matter .
Fascism and neo-Nazism are cancers !
The foul monster has been reawakened !
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might .
Europe was born out of a desire for peace , freedom and tolerance .
There is no question of it allowing xenophobic , racist and anti-Semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it .
Do not count on me to keep quiet , without doing or saying anything .
In yesterday ' s debate in the European Parliament some Members of this Parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a Member State .
Such a concern is misplaced .
The European Parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in Member States with which they disagree .
We have condemned Basque and Irish terrorism .
We have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities .
It is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elected voice of the European Union , to comment on current political developments in Austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament .
By commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in Austria from forming a coalition government .
We are nonetheless , as is our right as well as our responsibility , telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand .
Others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement .
Such a view is not only a political cop-out , it is positively dangerous .
That is why the European Union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in Austria .
We are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 Member States have employed on this issue .
The resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the Member States ' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty .
What is also missing is a paragraph concerning the EU ' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in Europe and Austria which have been among the prior conditions for Mr Haider ' s electoral success .
Today , as previously in the history of Europe , right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life .
The policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to EMU has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism .
A radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe .
- ( DE ) I am making this statement on behalf of the CSU .
It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State .
It has no right to do so .
Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed , there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition .
Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe .
This does not mean that we sympathise with Haider .
The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ .
However , as politicians we must ask the question why 27 % of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999 .
We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results .
Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics .
However , the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem .
For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution .
In this light , the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic .
For the first time since the Second World War , a party which is openly pro-Nazi , racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country .
This human diversity is our main sources of wealth , and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it , wherever it may exist .
For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria .
Jörg Haider ' s rise to power , with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government , is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth .
In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich , we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism .
- ( DE ) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ .
I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as " Europe 's scapegoat " ( or even worse , neo-Nazi and Super Racist ) to be counterproductive .
Of course I , in no way , agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime .
However , I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider 's adherents .
The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service .
The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility .
It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and , obviously in vain , offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts , that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider .
It turned its threatened loss of power into an " heroic battle for the preservation of values " and an imminent , pure-and-simple " decision between democracy and non-democracy " .
This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone .
We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them .
We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic , xenophobic and anti-minority .
Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments .
The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again .
It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions .
The ÖVP ( Austrian People 's Party ) , whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted , is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria .
It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles .
The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government .
This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic .
Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye .
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left .
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR .
In the meantime , they have been forming governments in German federal states .
I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today 's session .
He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values .
- ( FR ) I voted against the joint resolution on the situation in Austria .
Austria is a free , independent and sovereign country .
Consequently , neither the Council , the Commission nor the European Parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a Member State .
The Austrian elections were held in a free , proper and democratic manner .
Any interference by the European institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable ; it is in violation of the European Treaty ( Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam ) .
Nevertheless , these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union , despite its well-known human rights violations .
Nothing of this nature has yet occurred in Austria .
In such circumstances will it even be worth having elections ?
This is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of Europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future .
I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated .
I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union .
I urge the Commission to be less cautious .
In this resolution , Parliament is assuming its responsibilities .
Having said that , in my opinion , the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum , the very least we could do .
Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line , and I supported Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group .
In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party .
The Austrian People ' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this .
It is our fundamental values which are at stake here .
As the democratically elected representatives of the European people , we have no choice .
We must reject what is unacceptable , as our constituents demand .
Because , when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces , failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation .
I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution .
I condemn Jörg Haider ' s racist and xenophobic policy .
However , I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State .
I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution , and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution , even though it would be a vote against the extreme right .
- ( SV ) Obviously , the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party .
The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State , just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority .
Finland ' s experience , however , is that integration , rather than isolation , is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces .
I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights .
The EU Presidency ' s " common reaction " against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified . The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States .
Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights .
That concludes the vote .
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
( The sitting was closed at 12.25 p.m. )
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000 .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting on Thursday 3 February have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen .
I therefore propose to submit the Minutes for your approval tomorrow morning , since obviously you do not have them and I must apologise for this .
I shall therefore postpone the approval of the Minutes .
Madam President , on a point of order .
Thank you , Mr Davies .
I shall look into this matter with the College of Quaestors .
Madam President , on a point of order .
Happy Valentine ' s Day !
Madam President , I rise under Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure of this House and allude to the same point raised by Mr Davies about the very serious allegations made on BBC radio this morning .
Thank you , Mr Murphy .
As I informed Mr Davies , I promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors .
Madam President , on a point of order .
I have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the House .
I wonder on what point of order Mr Davies was speaking .
Why did he not mention the fact that one of his own Liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the BBC ?
Gentlemen , obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes .
They will look into the matter thoroughly .
Thank you , Mr Wurtz .
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , not to start a debate at this point . This was just a procedural motion .
Let me remind you , Mr Wurtz , that we shall be seeing Mr Prodi tomorrow . He is going to make a statement on the Commission ' s programme .
Naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement , just as Mr Prodi will be perfectly free to answer you .
I suggest that you clarify this matter at that time , if you so wish and if Mr Prodi agrees .
Madam President , it is with great regret that I have to trouble you yet again with an issue that I have raised here twice before .
I have already told you on a number of occasions that we , on behalf of the Dutch contingency , would like a Dutch television channel .
I was promised back in September that there would be a Dutch channel by January .
It is now February and we are still waiting .
I would ask you once again to work on this .
I wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a Dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite .
Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel , let me say how disappointed I am , because I personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago .
I have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and I believe that Mrs Banotti has an answer for you .
I shall therefore , with your permission , give the floor to Mrs Banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion .
Madam President , as my dear friend Elly will know , I will do anything to make her and my Dutch colleagues happy .
I would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio , and I have already started mailing colleagues in this connection .
If it is of any comfort to her , the Irish have not got their channel yet either .
There seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it .
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this .
I am not so sure that our Dutch Members will be reassured on the grounds that the Irish Members too are unable to receive a national channel .
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel .
Thank you , Mrs Banotti , and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this .
Austria , therefore , is perfectly entitled to form its government and the President of the Commission is perfectly entitled , and even duty bound , to offer Austria his best wishes .
Mr Wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party , the French Communist mayors , were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in France .
Agenda
The next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents , pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure .
a ) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday :
President .
Is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal ?
Since no one wishes to speak , I shall put this proposal to the vote .
( Parliament gave its assent ) Relating to Thursday :
President .
I have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance .
As you know , we can only include five items in the ' Human Rights ' section .
According to the list given in the final version of the agenda , there are already four items .
We can therefore table only one additional item .
Who wishes to speak on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party to propose the addition of an item on Cambodia ?
The international community has asked for justification for what is happening in Cambodia .
After all , we approved the elections in Cambodia , in what was one of the biggest fiascos on the electoral observation front .
Only this Parliament has emerged with some of its credit intact .
I think that we , as a Parliament , even now have to assume our responsibility and speak out on the situation in Cambodia .
( Parliament gave its assent ) President .
The item on Cambodia is therefore added to the ' Human Rights ' section . This renders the proposed item on Pinochet null and void .
In addition , I have received some proposals for subjects to be included in the topical and urgent debate .
Here we are not adding any more sub-items under the ' Human Rights ' heading , we are introducing new items .
I shall take the proposal from the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left first .
( Parliament rejected the proposal )
President .
We will now take the proposal from the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
Is there anyone to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , it is remarkable that the European Parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of Mr Pinochet , despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued .
It is inconceivable that the European Parliament , which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights , should fail to adopt a clear stance on this .
Madam President , this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time .
Firstly , the European Parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of General Pinochet , but , furthermore , there are certain questions to be borne in mind .
The first is that this matter is sub judice in several European countries , and I would like to remind Members that there is still no European judicial area nor a European legal system .
We are in favour of the International Criminal Court , but it does not yet exist .
I believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up , but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure .
We believe that justice should be done in this case , but this is not the most appropriate procedure .
( Parliament rejected the proposal ) President .
We now come to the third proposal which is for ' Environmental disasters in the waters of the Danube ' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster .
It affects not only Romania , but also Yugoslavia and , in fact , the entire Danube basin .
We consider the matter to be important enough for the Commission to react swiftly to this situation , and I think that Parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject .
( Parliament gave its assent ) President .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PPE in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , the agenda has been rearranged so many times that I would simply ask the Chamber to support the present proposal .
It is not a very time-consuming matter , but it is extremely important that it should get through Parliament now and that there should be no delays .
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting , which is an extremely urgent matter .
We have tried to drive this proposal through . I should therefore be very grateful indeed if the Chamber could support it .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Relating to Friday : President .
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal ?
Madam President , with apologies to my friend , Enrique Barón Crespo , I should like to speak against this proposal .
I am surprised it has even been made , because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the Conference of Presidents .
We already have a directive . It is not an old one , it was issued in 1997 .
I propose , therefore , that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda , with the debate on Friday and the vote at a later date .
Madam President , I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation , and I am going give this explanation before the whole House .
We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents .
At the time , I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter .
Madam President , I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about .
Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to , and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible .
That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats ' request to hold the vote on Friday .
( Parliament gave its assent )
Madam President , as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday ' s agenda .
That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday .
In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic .
Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote .
On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda .
That is absolutely absurd .
I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed .
This sounds perfectly feasible .
We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour , considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld ' s report .
This is all I am talking about here , just that .
Madam President , I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday , which you have not yet announced .
I understand that there is agreement on this issue .
These are serious allegations .
They are completely untrue , malicious , politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood .
We are taking legal advice . My colleagues ' register of interests is complete .
If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House .
Quite , we agree absolutely .
b ) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels
Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative
The next item is the joint debate on the four following reports :
Since Mrs McCarthy ' s flight has been delayed slightly , I propose that we hear from Mr Decourrière first .
Upon referral to committee , we examined over a hundred amendments and , so far , 17 amendments , some of which have already been presented in committee , have once again been tabled .
First of all , I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative , founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation .
This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale .
INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006 , and is the one with the largest budget for implementation , i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time .
The INTERREG initiative , created in 1990 , is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a ' Europe without frontiers ' in the context of establishing the great single market .
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996 , the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks .
These programmes promoted cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area .
Member States , i.e. national authorities , are responsible for implementing this strand .
The new INTERREG programme , in the form in which we have received it , takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and to island regions and most remote regions .
The European Commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand A and strand B. It bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period .
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds .
Proposals are drawn up by Member States and are submitted for approval to the European Commission , which checks their conformity with the general guidelines , adopted .
These proposals must include a number of elements , an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies , a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan .
In promoting cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation , this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the European scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the Community territory .
In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP .
The LEADER Community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs .
The following objectives were set : improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative ; promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector ; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas .
LEADER I applied to the rural areas covered by Structural Fund Objectives 1 and 5b , and 217 local action groups participated in it , with financing of EUR 1 155 million .
In October 1999 , following the success of LEADER I and LEADER II , the Commission decided to extend the initiative .
For the 2000-2006 period provision has been made , unfortunately , only for a total contribution of EUR 2 020 million , and an indicative allocation for each Member State has been set .
LEADER + differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible . It is also more ambitious , and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet .
I share the Commission ' s preference for the use of global grants while urging , however , that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and painstakingly defined .
I regret the delay with which LEADER , as was the case with the other three initiatives , was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure .
I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation , and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments .
This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion .
The initiative adopts a completely new approach , which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships .
The intention is clear : targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level , projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities .
This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House .
In addition , EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans .
It is an important Community initiative which , together with the three other initiatives , URBAN , LEADER and INTERREG , is financed out of the Structural Funds .
In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships .
Nevertheless , technical assistance is necessary .
Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice , with special emphasis on mainstreaming .
I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report .
This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises .
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers .
However , in this context , Madam President , to allow us to work out the details , I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday .
In this connection , the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament .
EQUAL should live up to its name , and this is my firm intention .
It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union .
It should prevent society from splintering .
It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life .
Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin .
That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support !
Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative .
Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000 .
Parliament , therefore , can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn .
Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy .
In my Member State , for example , we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities .
For example , in my own region , in Manchester , the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success .
URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK , in Moss Side .
The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs .
This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity .
As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative , they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity .
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes .
In committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50 .
We are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor .
Instead , we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal , to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect .
The Member States should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations .
In the designation of local URBAN programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas .
In the UK the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only EU but national and regional assistance programmes .
This needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the EU criteria .
I would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that .
Our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems : high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment , poverty and social exclusion .
Often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency .
We therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime , drug-dealing and gangs .
This is all too familiar in many of our urban areas .
All these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity .
Instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using EU resources as a value added to local actions .
I would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination , as provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty .
The Community initiative means community involvement . Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents .
We need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes .
The time-scale therefore proposed by the Commission is very ambitious .
It is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation .
The Commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice .
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks .
Finally , I should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation .
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems .
We shall thereby be able to replace poverty , dependency and alienation with equity , initiative and participation .
This will help us to restore the credibility of the EU and the confidence of citizens that Europe can deliver local action to solve local problems .
As we have heard , the objective of URBAN is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas , bearing in mind that 80 % of the population of Europe lives in cities .
The Communication from the Commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic , social , and infrastructural measures .
As the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs stressed in its opinion , the Commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding .
Not only is this coordination essential but , as we stated in our opinion , exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential .
That situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from European Union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities .
Addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities ' historical and cultural role .
Here , we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women , and the agencies that represent them , in planning and implementing the URBAN initiative programmes .
Mr President , our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the Commission for the URBAN programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention .
We considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration .
For this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind .
I should like to comment on the concerns which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has with regard to the largest of the four Community initiatives , INTERREG III .
It must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under INTERREG III .
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect .
In reality , however , the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects .
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures , especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment .
Employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand B , especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy .
However , I should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal .
It is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the EU is once again given the importance which it deserves .
The basic objectives of an EU-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability .
These objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy .
However , the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people ' s self-determination .
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives .
Mrs Stenzel ' s report has , however , turned out very well , at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned .
All asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes , although this should be self-evident .
Nevertheless the Conservatives voted against this in the committee .
I would ask them the following questions : does your policy seek to marginalise people ?
What is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so ?
Does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability ?
It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme , because there remains a shortcoming in the report .
Particular emphasis is given to the point that women ' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more crèches should be built .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism adopted this opinion on the EQUAL report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention .
I am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure .
The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments .
Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme .
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme .
The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators .
This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it has already been mentioned today that the first URBAN initiative was an unqualified success .
A new feature of the URBAN II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or parts of cities .
This is important because it is precisely small cities which often find it harder to access aid .
And yet the problems which give rise to the urgent need for regeneration can be particularly acute precisely in cities of this kind and thus have a proportionally adverse effect .
To increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for URBAN II has been limited to 50 .
In any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support .
There URBAN II would only be a drop in the ocean ; its success would be doubtful and the whole thing would be a flop .
Just as important in my view is not to broaden the selection criteria for URBAN II too much and thus water them down .
It is precisely a strictly defined list of criteria which is essential if the programmes which are funded are to be models and be transferable to other problem cities in the future .
Firstly , environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and the inclusion of this aspect should therefore be a general requirement for a project to receive funding .
Secondly , preventing and combating routine urban crime and crime related to drug dealing must start at local level .
These are essential steps towards increasing the quality of urban life and must therefore also play a central role in the URBAN II initiative .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time .
However , criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .
The reports are late , and , in addition , they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
A good opportunity to discuss the results , good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost .
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union .
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region , but , in my opinion , we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either .
Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG , TACIS , ISPA and PHARE programmes .
This coordination is at present lacking , and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it .
We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible .
It is of decisive importance to get local business , organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes .
Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful .
Projects have often remained half-finished , and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy .
We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement .
Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee .
It will not work as an automatic target , but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions .
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds .
Here , projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support ; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries .
Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money , that is only for the borders within the EU .
But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation .
The regulation pretends that there is one , but there is not .
The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years , although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time .
The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded .
Since 1996 , Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties .
Nothing has happened !
The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist , to the detriment of the regions concerned .
Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation , and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners .
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers !
Mr President , a third of EU money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes .
According to my group , this is excellent if , as a result of this , deprivation within regions , towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved .
That is a question of solidarity and progress .
But dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending .
The local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience .
They find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes .
Anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly , but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval .
Since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted , local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux .
The task of these experts is to gauge to what extent European Commission officials would be prepared to approve plans .
In some cases , I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems , but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union ' s blessing .
It seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the European Union .
Too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux , consultation and control , and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place .
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas , we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality .
After all , innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without European funding .
A second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils .
The emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities , non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces .
The discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied .
In this respect , one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the Dutch polder model , the structurally planned cooperation between government , trade unions and employers ' organisations .
Let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population .
So , really , these bodies should already provide for a balance , and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process .
My group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play , as their input in society is important in our view .
This could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start .
But the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that , unfortunately , democracy is not fully functioning yet .
One of the objections is that , due to the restricted role of the elected bodies , businesses gain more influence .
We believe in ' one man , one vote ' more than ' one share , one vote ' .
Mr President , there are economic frontiers within the European Union , and the internal market with the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is fully operating at this time .
Some areas within the European Union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita .
There are poor regions within the Union which need to be given European assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the European Union structure .
The core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the EU initiative programmes , namely , the new INTERREG III initiative , EQUAL and the LEADER + scheme .
Between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the EU to promoting cross-border development , combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes .
Mr President , quite a few towns and cities within the European Union have to contend with deprivation .
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately .
This is why it is useful for the European Union to continue to support the Member States and , if necessary , give additional support under URBAN .
Over the next seven years , the Commission ' s proposals concerning URBAN will entail a reduction in both the Community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit .
In common with Mrs McCarthy , I have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced .
It is desirable for Member States to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget .
As far as the budget is concerned , as already stated , URBAN is there to support and complement national policy .
In order to generate extra means if necessary , I think it is entirely logical to turn first to the Member States and private investors .
Consequently , we cannot support Amendment No 2 of the Greens , as borne out in the committee meeting .
In addition , I am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood , especially where Community contributions are concerned , should incentivise .
Structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence .
We would then be overreaching ourselves .
I would like to finish off by making a general comment on INTERREG .
In my opinion , funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions .
When projects are implemented , it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation .
According to the report issued by the Court of Auditors on the year 1998 , this is not an imagined risk .
Hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects .
Before I begin I will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which Austria has been prejudged by 14 Council representatives .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as part of the reform of the Structural Funds the Community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four .
I welcome the continuation of INTERREG and the priority which it has been accorded .
However , the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems .
The regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines , although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the Structural Funds .
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III , the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding .
That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects .
When INTERREG is implemented , it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned .
This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed .
This will cause practical problems in the future , and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas .
The preservation of this Community initiative in particular , in the form of a new version - LEADER + - is therefore greatly to be welcomed .
The new LEADER + programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union , which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects .
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER + and the other support initiatives in the European Union , but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important .
Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects .
In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome .
Attention must be paid in the LEADER + programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas ; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result .
LEADER must now move into the implementation phase .
The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission , which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible .
Five months are provided for this .
That seems to me to be rather too long .
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times .
Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible .
For me this raises the following questions : who will work there ?
How will these people be selected ?
Where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observatory be located ?
In addition , experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that , apart from rather dubiously creating jobs , they are not of any great benefit .
I would therefore call on the Commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that LEADER + programmes run smoothly .
Assessment and publication are part of this , and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past .
Mr President , the majority of the borders , which have divided Europe for centuries , were artificially created , separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion .
Our internal borders , or what remains of them , no longer cause wars , but they do continue to generate economic backwardness , social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe .
The Community ' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border scars , which contradict the spirit of European unity .
The economic and social cohesion which we propose is based , by means of the INTERREG initiative , on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent .
INTERREG has always been at the heart of a genuine Community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our European territory .
Although the European Parliament supports this initiative , our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of INTERREG II .
The people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together , of innovation , of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other .
There are many interesting questions relating to it , the monitoring centre , the principle of concentration etc . However , I would like to concentrate on the management bodies .
We must create joint , interregional and transnational management bodies , in which all local and regional authorities , as well as economic and social operators , play an active role .
There must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border .
A project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication .
During debates in committee , we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating INTERREG with other annual or biannual financial instruments , such as MEDA , TACIS or PHARE .
This Parliament ' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties , making proposals capable of solving them to the Commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes .
It is a sad fact that there are many hundreds , if not thousands , of communities in the European Union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage .
The programme has been extremely successful in Ireland , as indeed I know it has been successful in other countries .
It was quite slow in getting off the ground there , but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes .
It is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative .
It would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the URBAN programme .
This , unfortunately , is not the case in Ireland .
I applaud the innovative approach of the EQUAL programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market .
The development partnerships are a very clever idea , even though they are experimental .
I have two major concerns , however , about the development partnerships .
They should be accessible to smaller groups , accessible for them to be able to devise , implement and monitor the programmes .
We need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .
I have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon , so that it becomes accessible to everyone .
I am glad to see that this was accepted into the report , but I cannot agree with Amendment No 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all .
My second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems , for example , disabled people ' s access to the workplace .
Projects should also specifically address this problem . These concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes .
I certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the West Midlands .
I now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees .
It is only fair and right for them to be able to access EQUAL in the same way as everyone else .
Thank you , Mr President .
Ladies and gentlemen , with the LEADER report , rural development is very much to the fore .
This does not happen all that often and it is gratifying , especially as the LEADER programmes have been key elements in the Union ' s rural development policy .
It must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the LEADER programme , local operators have combined forces , debated and prepared projects .
These programmes have , therefore , been important channels for participative democracy , the rationale of the citizen for Europe .
So , the concept for LEADER + should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes .
One urgent question is therefore raised : why , when this programme has been successfully run for ten years , is LEADER + still classed as experimental ?
Are there so many other European schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful ?
For how much longer is the Commission going to leave LEADER at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development ?
Moreover , I wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the Commission wishes to restrict LEADER + .
As an ecologist , let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches .
In this connection , the Commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries .
The fact is , showing solidarity with Eastern Europe , is all very well , but it is not enough .
The tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south , particularly the countries around the Mediterranean , must not be abandoned .
Mr President , I have a few very brief comments .
We are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four Community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period .
This is not very good at all .
Programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory , while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud .
The Community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions .
They must , however , not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy , but must develop their own self-sufficient role .
For example , adapting EQUAL to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts .
Extending the LEADER initiative to every area in the Union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more , to the benefit of more developed areas .
Mr President , rural development has been identified by this Parliament and the Commission as a priority policy area , and I would like to welcome here today the Commissioner responsible , Commissioner Fischler .
Our response to rural decline has come late in the day , but I suppose better late than never .
Family farming is now recognised as central to the European agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed , certainly within the time-scale of Agenda 2000 .
In my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms .
It behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival .
As the Commissioner knows , farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities .
For this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development .
In this regard LEADER has established itself as an effective development initiative .
It provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems .
The voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated .
Yet , through LEADER , there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader EU and national policy .
In conclusion , while welcoming Commission approval for LEADER + , I am concerned about the time delay between the ending of LEADER II and the commencement of the new programme .
I urge you to look seriously at this problem .
A break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers .
EQUAL is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light , doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds .
This is an arduous task .
Only , the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped .
Comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another .
Although a few other groups have been mentioned , it is the Member States , in particular , which are on the lookout .
For example , I know of one Member State that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component , namely refugees .
I would , therefore , ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups .
It should not be the case that one Member State , under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle , can decide that all funding should go to one group .
This is not the case !
It has to be redistributed time and again . It should be used for innovative projects and it should not completely disappear into the Finance Minister ' s treasury funds .
That is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here .
I believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this Parliament , and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance , can be solved .
As far as the Commission is concerned , I hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this Parliament , mainly with a view to reaching a balance .
I believe that this is actually a good thing .
The position of Parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear .
The Rules of Procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful .
Mr President , there is no doubt that the INTERREG initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the European Union .
For Greece , for the neighbouring countries Italy and Austria , but also for Europe as a whole , the social and economic restoration of the Balkans , bringing political stability , is a vitally important matter .
So far , some Balkan countries have received aid from the PHARE and Obnova programmes , while others have not .
Accordingly , we welcome the related references in Chapter 7 of the European Commission ' s proposed general guidelines for INTERREG .
We therefore ask the Commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review .
I end by stressing the need for the European Union to persist with such initiatives , which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions , and to foster their harmonious development .
And since this is St. Valentine ' s day , as a former Mayor of a regional city , I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love .
Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured .
We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating .
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside .
And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore .
The investment needs to be visionary .
Young , creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside .
If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more .
None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate , all-round distribution , and the pilot projects need to act , as it were , like avalanches and trigger other similar projects .
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and , even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there , overall they were certainly positive .
Mr President , I want to talk about the EQUAL report , especially the issue of the policy on refugees .
Last week , we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government .
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention , that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees .
In actual fact , it is the other refugees , namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid , who need aid the most .
The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions .
Some members of the Committee , however , supported Mrs Stenzel ' s proposal and wordings .
As I see it , this means that Mr Haider ' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament .
It is therefore crucially important that the Chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the EQUAL programme .
I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time .
Mr President , during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999 , when there were 13 different initiatives in operation , the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative .
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe , a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States .
The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States .
The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme , which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years .
The European Union is the single largest contributor , with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland . The European Union contributes 75 % of the Peace and Reconciliation programme .
All in all , INTERREG , the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process .
Mr President , I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG , but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms , which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time .
We have all spoken favourably of this programme ' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation , in addition to cross-border cooperation .
We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament ' s position in practical terms , and not just with a formal tribute .
This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature .
This is in line with ongoing discrimination , which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies .
More serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as Malta .
For a long time , probably a survival of our colonial heritage , our regions have fixed their attention on the European mainland , ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours .
That time is now past .
This increased awareness does not , however , affect identity alone .
It is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets .
So , for example , the island of Réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern Africa and those of south-east Asia .
It cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area , lest it miss out on a historic opportunity , and the same applies to our regions in the Caribbean .
INTERREG appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable European Union bridgeheads into these geographical areas , giving it worldwide scope .
I am counting on the Commission , and specifically on you , Commissioner , to allocate adequate resources for effective action .
I understand the Commission ' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation .
Nonetheless , there are many maritime areas between which links are already established .
Various local authorities around the North Sea provide a prime example of this .
INTERREG could well allow enhancement of such cooperation .
Such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the EU . I hope for their adoption .
There is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared .
We also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level .
My group will not be supporting those amendments .
We are also concerned at the number of amendments which , in seeking to introduce greater flexibility , run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the EQUAL initiative .
Mr President , I am very pleased to see URBAN orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems .
Yet , there is some risk of dilution of effort . If we pursue too many objectives , our overall effectiveness suffers .
Of course , every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case .
But there is a common factor , a hard core , comprising unemployment , the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises , both commercial and other kinds .
I would wish URBAN to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I shall confine my observations to Mr Decourrière ' s report .
INTERREG must , therefore , be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory .
Indeed , I am forced to observe that this was not the case when the Commission drew up its communication , published on 13 October last year .
In this connection , I should like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the EDF to the list of these funds .
Furthermore , I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication .
Finally , in conclusion , I would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand C , for interregional cooperation , even though the added value this offers the Community is undeniable .
Unfortunately , it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .
A breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas , however .
If that is the case , we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times .
No , equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life .
Unfortunately , developments are not moving in that direction .
On the contrary .
I think , therefore , that paragraph 7 contains something very central , i.e. that EQUAL will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies .
One can only hope that it succeeds .
One of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the LEADER programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned .
I am glad that LEADER + is to remain true to this underlying concept .
There is a problem , however , which we need to address together .
And because of the programme ' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from LEADER .
Of course this is also the basic idea .
Here we must ensure that the good schemes , those which are really excellent , are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work .
My request to the Commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted .
Have faith in the successful results which LEADER has had so far .
At the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic .
And then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy , including ourselves at this level , could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well .
That was the charm of LEADER , and that should please not be lost !
Mr President , I welcome the EQUAL initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups .
Women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender .
This is why specific action for women is needed , as well as mainstreaming .
The involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the EQUAL initiative and the projects .
The development partnerships within the thematic fields , which are referred to in Amendment No. 22 , would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the EQUAL initiative .
My group will be supporting Amendment No. 22 .
Mr President , the report under discussion in the House today is doubtless of great importance .
In my opinion , it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the European Union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas .
Indeed , these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the Union .
It is precisely with this in mind that I tabled some amendments which I consider to be of the utmost importance , and that the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism has subsequently taken up .
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament ' s position on the matter , in accordance with the Code of Conduct .
There are fundamental advantages for the whole of Europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , LEADER I was an outright success due , in particular , to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the Commission and the local operators .
I am pleased to see , however , that under LEADER + , new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development .
I feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment , in order to promote employment .
The time is now right , I think , to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation .
It is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for LEADER II .
There must , of course , be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups .
Like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand IIIA .
With regard to INTERREG , we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a European monitoring centre concerned with cooperation .
I would like to thank the rapporteurs , particularly Mr Decourrière , for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments .
I hope that the Commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making .
Mr President , with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon , I would like to concentrate strictly on one of them , that is , the URBAN programme .
It is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the European Parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained .
The Commission proposed removing it and other initiatives , but Parliament ' s proposal and the sensitivity of the Commission itself at the time led to the URBAN initiative being retained .
I believe that we should be pleased about this .
But what were the Commission ' s arguments , from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular , for eliminating the URBAN programme ?
Its argument was one of priority .
The urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget .
Today the programme is in place and therefore I believe we have achieved something important , that distinguishing mark of the European Union called the URBAN programme .
However , I would like to address Commissioner Barnier and support the argument of Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and the Director-General , because I think they were absolutely right .
The urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds .
Organisations of disabled people and disabled people ' s non-disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision-making .
That is why this Parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution , to ensure that Member States cannot ignore any one target group .
Disabled people have too often been left off the list .
Former ADAPT projects range from the CORE project , which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in Bedfordshire , to projects to raise standards in small businesses in Hertfordshire in Essex .
We have seen the NOW project helping 70 women to return to work in Suffolk , many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the European Parliament in Brussels .
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed , which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market .
Finally , a word on INTERREG .
It really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links .
During this period the ports of Great Yarmouth and Harwich on the Essex-Suffolk-Norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the Netherlands .
I urge Parliament to support our Amendment No 2 , which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas , particularly on maritime borders .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the information of the House , Mr President , I should like to make a clarification .
Chancellor Schüssel ' s government will maintain the refugee policy of the former social democratic government led by Chancellor Klima .
There is no change in refugee policy in Austria !
Rural areas make up over 80 % of the EU ' s territory and 25 % of the population live in them .
As a farmer and Member of Parliament , I have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole .
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER + programme because of its comprehensive nature .
In the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the EU .
This across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way .
In the future , funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone .
It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the EAGGF is supposed to be an effective financial instrument .
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness , because the money should not be squandered recklessly .
In addition , I should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy .
There is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside .
That is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers .
LEADER + should supplement already existing programmes , avoid overlaps and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible .
The Commission would have abolished URBAN , but this time Parliament drew the longer straw .
It is good that URBAN is to continue , as it has had good results at local level .
The problems in Europe ' s urban areas are getting worse ; fortunately , we now have consensus with the Commission .
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities , and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves .
There is an immense risk of exclusion .
In many cities in France and England there are now slums , breeding grounds for many sorts of problems .
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe .
We have to act now , before it is too late .
Our cities are also of decisive importance for Europe ' s economy .
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe : our economy does not support the individual sufficiently , nor is it sufficiently dynamic .
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment .
This is not policy ; it is life ' s simple logic .
It is good that spending has become focused , as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds .
Now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities , as they do not have enough resources .
In this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas ; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand .
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship , as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally .
Mr President , with the implementation of INTERREG III , European cooperation policy is entering a new phase .
Our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones .
The Union ' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development , but - on the contrary - an opportunity , a bridge to more fruitful cooperation .
That is a reduction of 3 ¾ % compared with the previous CIs .
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL , as Mrs Stenzel ' s balanced report makes clear .
This makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing .
How are priorities supposed to be set here ?
There is agreement on the principle that marginalisation , discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced .
Transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs .
I have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the TAOs .
Criticism of the previous Commission ' s work was particularly severe , legitimately so , with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices .
Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was , after all , in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to LEONARDO .
The Commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under EQUAL either .
The Commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices .
Only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved .
Mr President , I want to refer to the Commission proposals on the budget line to promote the CAP .
On 26 October 1999 the European Commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the CAP .
This proposal will remove the current budget line B2-5122 and create a new budget heading B1-382 .
Actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the EU and also create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important .
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme .
Given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy .
Informing and training young farmers at European level is vitally important .
I would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst European young farmers .
Regarding information and training , in the past this budget line has been allocated for information , communication and training .
But the Commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included . I feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at European level about the CAP .
Such European training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the CAP to make sound business decisions for the future .
Therefore I am putting forward three amendments .
I would urge Parliament to support them .
Secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres , within these old quarters of our cities .
These people live in areas which should benefit from these projects .
I think however that you will all recognise your own comments .
Firstly on the subject of the URBAN programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns , which a number of you termed arbitrary .
I can understand your concern .
That is my initial response to the threshold question .
Third point : specific measures in favour of some social groups - some speakers mentioned them - women , but also immigrants and refugees , must be envisaged .
This concern , ladies and gentlemen , lies at the very heart of our URBAN initiative , and I am willing to rewrite the text , if necessary , in order to make this message clearer yet .
Regarding URBAN , I should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention , first of all , the selection procedure .
Some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic , more transparent , and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding .
Ladies and gentlemen , on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for URBAN is primarily the responsibility of the Member States .
A second observation , the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes .
I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme .
This cannot , however , be grounds for an extension of the original time limit .
Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months .
With regard to URBAN , I should like to conclude with a final observation .
One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative .
I agree completely .
I am not forgetting , and we cannot forget , that 80 % of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important .
Let me repeat what I have said , we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming .
Having made these general observations , I should like to focus on your main comments with regard to INTERREG .
The first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative .
You comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date , stressing , particularly your rapporteur , the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted .
It is true , I admit it , and you are well aware of the reasons , ladies and gentlemen .
There is a delay in adopting the INTERREG guidelines in March or April 2000 .
I accept this ; I take note of it as you do .
I note , however , that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for INTERREG III and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now .
So much for the first comment .
Third point : interregional cooperation , the importance of strand C. The Commission shares the observations made by this House regarding the importance of strand C , interregional cooperation .
As your rapporteur has requested , I shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand .
Fourth observation : the European Observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office .
I also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between INTERREG and the EDF , particularly for the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean .
All this should make it possible for us , apart from the Objective 1 appropriations and also with them , to confirm the role of ' active frontier ' of the Union .
Another point : the coordination between INTERREG , PHARE , TACIS and MEDA .
It is true , once again , and I accept this objectively , that there are still real legal problems .
The Commission must continue along these lines .
I am making a personal commitment to do so .
Finally , on the subject of technical assistance , on which your rapporteur and several of you commented .
According to the general regulations , however , any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a Community initiative must be proposed under Article 20 , and not Article 23 .
This means that the ceiling of 0.25 % mentioned in Article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance .
My conclusion regarding INTERREG , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , is that these Community initiatives for which I am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this .
They also foreshadow a real European regional planning policy within our enlarged Union .
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to this , just as you yourselves do .
So we are working within this framework and not outside it .
Everything that I have just said , ladies and gentlemen , demonstrates that the Commission is resolved to taken the views of Parliament into account .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report .
This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas , ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models .
In addition , I note that Parliament shares the Commission ' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER + is the use of global grants .
Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today , I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER + .
The various groups , be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment , have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives .
And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either ; there will be more .
I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new .
There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II .
It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups .
The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2 % of the LEADER budget .
I now come to the content of the report .
In point 14 , Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately .
We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme ' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation .
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .
In point 18 , Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives .
In response I can only say that this already exists .
It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested .
In point 21 , Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER + now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start .
I can only fully share your concern .
I assume that the Commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in March or April .
And as soon as these are published in the Official Journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit LEADER + programmes .
I believe that it is important to point out one thing : expenditure effected under LEADER + is eligible from the time that the Commission programme starts running .
For all programmes submitted before 30 April of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 January .
Finally , under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines .
Having given them thorough consideration , I can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 are acceptable to the Commission and are adopted .
The proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under LEADER + is a maximum of 5 months .
That therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3 . The Commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the Commission itself had originally proposed .
I must add , however , that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States .
An amendment was therefore made in the committee , but the Commission will now again take account of Parliament ' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form .
It will also continue to fight for Member States ' acceptance of this .
I will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled .
Here there are only three which the Commission cannot accept , Amendments Nos 3 , 12 and 13 . It can accept all of the others either in full or in essence .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the EQUAL initiative in the European Parliament just at this time .
Recently , because of political developments in Austria , there is growing unease within Europe . Political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue .
It is worth stressing that both Parliament and the Commission must put forward specific policies .
We need specific proposals , both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies .
So I will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible .
I now come to the EQUAL initiative , which is , of course , based on Article 13 .
The EQUAL initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of Article 13 , namely the fight against discrimination based on race , gender , age , and special needs .
The first comment , which has been made by many others too , is whether women should be mentioned separately .
So on the basis of the Treaty as it stands today , the EQUAL initiative is structured in that way .
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups .
Firstly , the enlargement of the thematic areas .
As in employment strategy , there are four thematic areas : employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities , and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the European Parliament ' s proposals .
The second subject is flexibility and simplification .
I agree with Mr Leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand .
That is why the services are already trying to revise the text , simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp .
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs .
Of course , a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the Member States , and a network which will assist the exchange of experience .
Finally , I would like to mention technical assistance .
Since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided , we must say that external offices will be used .
As Mr Barnier too pointed out , it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission ' s staff .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the Bureau and to the appropriate committees .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon .
( The sitting was closed at 8.40 p.m. )
Approval of the Minutes of the two previous sittings
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 3 February and Monday 14 February have been distributed .
The Minutes of 3 February were originally distributed in Brussels so perhaps this is why some Members did not receive them .
Are there any comments ?
( The Minutes were approved )
Madam President , my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on Monday afternoons at 5.00 p.m.
If Air France insists on boycotting the European Parliament , we should take measures to prevent this occurring again .
Thank you , Mr Medina Ortega .
I too wholeheartedly regret this situation .
Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government ?
This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly .
Madam President , I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday .
I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union .
Absolutely , Mr Napolitano . Thank you .
She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow .
Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent , she was still held in custody all day .
Thank you , Mr Lannoye .
I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative .
Madam President , I should like to make a request in connection with today ' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report .
I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point .
I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL .
We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning .
Madam President , to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made : Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane .
I have a lot of sympathy with that protest .
I have , however , no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity .
I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane .
I did not hide behind any immunity .
I took the punishment that came to me .
Mrs Lucas should do the same .
Madam President , I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow .
Does anyone want to speak against Mrs Stenzel ' s request , as supported by Mrs Ghilardotti ?
If not , then we will proceed to the vote .
( Parliament approved the request )
Madam President , under Rule 29 ( 4 ) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group .
Have you received any notification of any Members leaving the Group of the European People 's Party or does the Austrian People 's Party continue to sit in that political group ?
Mr Corbett , I have not received any notification .
Madam President , I am amazed at Mr Corbett ' s reaction .
He should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here .
We are solidly with our Austrian friends who have proven to be good Europeans in the past .
They have our full support .
( Applause )
Agenda
( Parliament gave its assent )
Commission 's strategic objectives and legislative programme
The next item is the joint debate on the Commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000 .
I therefore immediately give the floor to the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking , and this is why I preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech , which is available in four languages .
Let us remember that for half a century , Europe has provided us with peace , security and freedom and a united Europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity .
The crisis in the Commission was , in fact , a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens , and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this .
This is not the first time this has happened : Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation , an explosion of its markets , a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world .
I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down .
Today , Europe is facing a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history has been unforgiving in the past , it will not be forgiving in the present .
But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena .
In years past , the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions , the mainstay of European life .
The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005 , a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar , so I will not go into detail about it now .
Some of you may find it lacks detail , but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes .
This is the European Union , not the Soviet Union .
These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years .
This is an effective , transparent way to proceed and involve all the European institutions and the citizens of Europe .
But it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink : as I said a few moments ago , it is also economic and political globalisation itself .
It will not be a philosophical Paper , but a practical Paper , full of focused proposals .
I have asked all the Commissioners - and I shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo .
As for internal reform , you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one .
Providing aid rapidly , when it is needed , saves human lives ; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all .
When I speak about external aid , my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans . There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground , an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems .
This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans .
We must increase our efficiency in this area . We must reopen the Danube to boats .
It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource .
We must decontaminate the river and , in view of this , over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem .
We have done a lot in the Balkans : the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo , the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures .
Nevertheless , we definitely have to do more .
If we do not do this , we shall have failed in our duty .
This is what we need to do for the Balkans .
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security , peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage .
We are clearly , once again , returning to enlargement , which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security , peace and freedom .
We have made many promises in this regard , but I believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread .
There will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process .
I repeat : we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own Member States with even greater reassurance .
Our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement , or at the Balkans .
In this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of Africa .
We need to provide alternative answers , otherwise episodes such as those seen in Seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of Europe ' s positive roles in history .
All over the world , Europe ' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities .
We should remember that we , the European Union , are a union of minorities : we are all a minority within Europe .
There are concerns even within the Fifteen , concerns which may even surface again in the next decade .
Some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message I sent to Chancellor Schüssel .
My message to you is : do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that I have been less firm in the content .
Reread the letter : The reference to the fundamental values of the Union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from Article 6 of the Treaty , I repeat , Article 6 of the Treaty .
I would also ask you whether you believe that any other European head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the Commission when they were elected .
This is what we wish to do : maintain our role as a supranational structure , maintain the role conferred on us by the Treaties , but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts .
Last November , the Commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive .
I would ask the Council to adopt it swiftly and I would ask Parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion .
I will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme : the economy and quality of life .
I have already talked about the economy : we well know which basic ingredients will set Europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs .
The forthcoming Lisbon Summit on these issues - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .
It has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind .
We are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers .
Finally , our last commitment is to improve quality of life .
We have opened this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety : we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector .
The Erika oil slick and the contamination of the Danube demonstrates the pressing need for European scale intervention to safeguard the environment .
The time has come to discuss , and then establish , a body for emergency civil protection in Europe .
All too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred .
I think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen .
These are the challenges that we - the Commission but also all the other European institutions - are facing .
How will we judge , ladies and gentlemen , Madam President , the five years of our mandate ?
How are we going to assess the results of these five years ?
I do not know , but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together .
Let us take a very simple parameter : turnout at the next European elections .
If it is higher than at the previous elections , it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are faced with all these major political challenges , but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway , we are also faced with major opportunities .
This , ladies and gentlemen , could be the decade of Europe .
Indeed , I would say that this must be the decade of Europe .
We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document .
And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given .
We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes .
Europe will press ahead with integration ; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will , in the end , reunite our continent .
A demanding , ambitious , perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success , Mr President of the Commission .
However , we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present .
I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully .
I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union .
We in the European Union are one Community .
We belong together , even when there are problems .
Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe .
Mr President of the Commission , you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks .
You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties , and that is indeed your role .
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned , we expressly respect , acknowledge and support you .
( Applause )
Mr President of the Commission , our objectives are one and the same : we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century , a democratic Europe which is able to act .
Europe ' s message , the European Union ' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism , no ; it must be one of cooperation , partnership and peaceful development .
Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world , which is becoming smaller and smaller , as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity .
Seen in this light , globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger , more of a coming together than a segregation , more mutual enrichment than separation .
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans .
But we also say : we want to defend this European Community of tolerance , which is why a common foreign , security and defence policy is so important .
Negotiations with six central European countries are starting today , bringing the European family a step closer together .
We agree with what you said about the Barcelona process . All the countries in the Mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity , democracy and the rule of law .
We therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact .
We need structural reforms in the European economy .
Most importantly , we need to restore a European economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs .
It would be Europe ' s undoing if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium-sized businesses in Europe .
( Applause ) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays .
We too want to help put Europe on its feet .
You spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity .
We support that .
The nations , regions , towns and communities of Europe will be preserved .
I merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where I would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future .
Mr President of the Commission , allow me to close with these words : as the Group of the European People ' s Party and the European Democrats , we have every interest in a strong Commission .
If you are persuasive in your actions , we all reap the benefits .
In this respect we wish you every success . However , we are also aware of our role as the Commission ' s watchdog .
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world .
( Applause )
We are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances .
What we need here is good government , Madam President .
Since we are recovering from a very complex crisis , we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance .
I would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there were some Groups which said that the majority of Parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the Council .
It is precisely this which , in a sense , is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme .
I am pointing this out because I believe that our support for the Commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature .
On the other hand , we are witnessing the birth of a political Europe , which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon , and a European Union at the service of the citizens .
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point .
In this regard , Madam President , I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language .
Last week , the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre .
Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments .
There can be no democracy without a living parliament .
I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now .
With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us , I would say that we are very much in agreement .
Nevertheless , I would point out to the Commission that , as far as the Socialist Group is concerned , there has been a change of priorities .
We must argue for equality of the sexes , the famous ' gender mainstreaming ' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission ' s programme .
This means prioritising sex equality , the adaptation of the social model and , above all , an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat .
This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission .
I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue .
In this respect I would also add another element , which is economic government , given the single currency , and I believe this is inescapable .
This is another question on which the Commission must make progress .
Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision ?
The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential .
With regard to governance in general , I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms .
I would like to remind you of one thing : it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here .
I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity .
If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is , I think that would be very positive .
In all other areas , I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion .
Not only should the Commission discuss this , but also our states , our parliaments and our civil society .
We must not forget Africa , a continent which has been forsaken , not only by God , but also by Europe , nor our important contribution to cooperating with development .
It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions , for which Europe has an enormous responsibility .
This is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us . I hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next European elections .
They are political because we are moving on .
Even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks , we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of Europe to a much more challenging political perspective .
The challenge of enlargement is political .
The challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs , of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime , is very political .
The challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political .
Because it is political it is more complex . Because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive .
Because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive .
We need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives , to address , not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy , the apathy which you identify .
The means of achieving this are difficult but they are real .
We need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society .
We need more explanation of what Europe is about .
We need to be able to confront fears and anxieties , because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself .
Perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that .
My group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a White Paper next spring addressing the issue of governance .
As we look at the Europe of networking which you describe , it is very important that Europe concentrates on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest areas where Europe may perhaps stand back .
That could convince people that Europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from Brussels , which concentrates and soaks up more powers , more decisions , more authority .
That is the political core of the challenge and I think you have identified it well before this House today .
We see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of " them and us " .
We see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states .
We need to be able to prepare that ground carefully .
On south-eastern Europe , I agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements .
In the lifetime of this Commission and this Parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern Europe .
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements , but we would like to see more .
We will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the Swoboda report later this week .
The strategic paper emphasises the global role of the European Union .
Our central aim must be to give the Union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid , trade and finance .
We need to open that debate .
In conclusion , this morning , the day after St Valentine 's Day , the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over .
I do not know whether you are a romantic or not , Mr Prodi .
Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning .
However , we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business .
That is the way it should be .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally .
You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme .
I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones .
At the same time , however , it has to be said that , unfortunately , your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto .
There are a lot of good intentions in it , but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved .
As in any other party manifesto , it is full of contradictions .
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .
First let me speak about the economy and social development .
We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment ; that is what was mentioned in your programme .
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone .
In this respect , Parliament will definitely defend , along with yourselves , the importance of supranational decision-making .
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation .
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of ' global administration ' , as others too have said here .
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community .
Do please try to make the international organisations democratic .
The European Union could be critically important in a process in which the United Nations and the WTO really do become subject to democratic monitoring .
We can submit motions for this together with you .
Finally , I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society , although , unfortunately , this is another contradiction .
You ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the IGC .
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making .
What you just said is absolutely true : people want more engaged democracy .
In my opinion , this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to Europe and their interest in Europe too .
The main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists .
We are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which Mr Prodi has just underlined and , in some cases , usefully clarified .
There are plenty of areas for serious discussion .
We will carefully study the planned White Papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised .
A more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view .
My second criticism follows on from the first .
But all is not lost .
My group is fully intent on helping with this work .
Madam President , reforming and democratising the institutions of the European Union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process .
This was the opening statement of Commission President , Prodi , when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years .
We await the White Paper on the governance of the European Union dealing with the issue of balance between Member States ' governments and the European Union institutions which is to be published this summer .
On this specific point I think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the Commission .
The Commission , in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller Member States lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the European Commission .
This is a scenario whereby the European Union has a membership of over 25 Member States .
I do not want to see a two-tier European Union built .
I believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties .
There must be equality in terms of national representation within the Commission and within all the other European institutions .
More or less each of the 50 states in the US has two elected positions in the United States Senate , regardless of its population .
Any future reforms of the European Union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country .
Undoubtedly , reform of the European Council is also going to be included in this White Paper on the governance of the European Union which will be published this summer .
Once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national Member States .
I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation , justice and home affairs , and foreign affairs at European Union level .
At present , under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome , decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity .
I believe that this proposal should remain , as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union .
I support the enlargement of the European Union .
I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner .
However , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties .
Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed .
Madam President , I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members .
President of the Commission , a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans .
What do we expect from a government in any case ?
What do we ask of this structure - the European Community - which is , so to speak , ambiguous and unique ?
It is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the Member States or the TAOs , as has been the case in the past .
It seems that you are proposing the same old menu , but with more unsatisfactory implications , restricting the Commission , so you say , to the task of drawing up a few White Papers , as you proposed .
If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far , I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do .
Mr Prodi , there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you , perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members , regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government .
We approve of your position on this : you did well not to isolate that country any further .
In any case , we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action .
Mr Prodi , I repeat that this is , in our opinion , a slightly short-sighted view .
Above all , it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned , for example , as regards the Balkans .
Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process , disregarding the fact that Croatia , Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all ?
I remember your predecessor ' s speech five years ago .
You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation .
You talk about greater transparency , but produce proposals which would lead to documents which , at present , are available for public inspection being locked away .
Your Commission consists of the only 20 people in the EU who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced .
Local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in Brussels .
The legislative programme from the Commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the Member States and to the processes of popular democracy .
Otherwise , the number of laws produced in Brussels will just keep on growing .
We have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments , and the applicant States have had 26 000 documents sent to them which , as debated by the Polish parliament , fill 140 000 sides of paper .
Even by this stage , that is already too many by far .
I should also just like to draw Mr Dell ' Alba ' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of .
Take a look at Jean Monet ' s memoirs .
What he envisaged was what he called a small , practical secretariat .
That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today .
We accept that Europeans , particularly the younger generation , need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead .
But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high ?
We need to match this vision with reality .
Here there are three elements I would like to contribute .
Firstly , we need a successful European economy .
But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation , stifling individual initiative and enterprise .
We must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society .
Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead , particularly of enlargement .
Secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity .
Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too .
We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation .
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes .
Lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the European Commission .
Yes , the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body , but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament .
The Commission is not in fact today a European government .
The Commission does not reflect the majority in this particular Parliament .
We in Parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in Europe .
This governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the European Union , has its relevant role to play .
Therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the European Union to our citizens .
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions .
That does not apply to Austria alone .
The Union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the Treaty of Amsterdam and the institutions of the EU confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in Austria .
When it comes down to it , Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty are not enough .
In this sense , the Commission must insist , and I should like to endorse and confirm this here , that the new Charter of Fundamental Rights become part of the Treaty and create binding , enforceable rights .
In this sense , the Commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom , security and justice and in this sense I disagree with the last two speakers .
Only reasonable , feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational , misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right .
In this respect , Mr President of the Commission , I too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population .
The Union , like everyone else , has not yet understood how to present the EU to the citizens of the EU as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation .
We are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house .
In this respect , what the Commission says about boosting Europe ' s voice is important .
In this sense , the USA is not only our partner ; it is also our competitor ; not our opponent , our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model .
I hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the Commission documents .
You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called " core tasks " .
That , as you have said yourself today , means that you must also identify tasks , policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission 's main vocation .
Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date , or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level .
The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national , regional and local government .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , I fully support the thinking of the proposals made by my colleague , Mrs Hautala , on the Commission ' s strategic objectives for the coming five years .
I myself want to refer to a subject which has not been mentioned but which is on the agenda , namely the Commission ' s work programme for 2000 .
Rather , I want to start by welcoming certain proposals which you have made in this programme for 2000 .
These include all the proposals on food safety which are ambitious and important and those on maritime safety which are particularly important given the two oil slicks which have affected the coast of Brittany and Turkey .
The Commission should react quickly in this respect .
However , on other issues the proposals could be more ambitious and faster acting .
I have some positive suggestions to make , particularly on the social area , the environment and the follow-up to Seattle .
Firstly , you have said that the citizens of Europe must be reconciled with the institutions .
This is self-evident and it is therefore essential to find out their main concerns .
For example , in the social area , it is not enough to announce a communication on a programme of social action .
We must move faster .
You must submit a new social action programme to us by the end of the year .
The issue of company closures and mass redundancies is one which has been and still is very firmly in the news .
On the environment , you have announced a proposal for a decision on a sixth action programme on the environment .
This is all very well but it seems that the text to be proposed will not contain any specific objectives or a timetable for implementation . Perhaps you can correct me on this .
I personally feel that it is essential to have precise objectives and a proper timetable for implementation .
In terms of civil liability for the environment , it is right that we finally have a White Paper .
However , Parliament did ask for a legislative initiative six years ago .
The White Paper clearly foreshadows this legislation but for when ?
You must realise that this process needs to be accelerated .
Finally , after Kyoto , we should be able to rapidly produce precise proposals .
Finally , on the subject of the WTO , the idea of relaunching a new global round is not necessarily bad .
However , in the first place , the Commission should make proposals on changing the operational rules of the WTO .
The Commission has a role both within the EU and throughout the world .
The European Union must therefore instigate a re-evaluation of the WTO ' s operation which must lead to precise proposals being made on its rules .
Madam President , you spoke about fundamental political values , and one of the fundamental political values , even more important than democracy , is respect for others .
Enlargement - and Alleanza Nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this House - must not mean dilution , that is , it must not entail more risks .
Even today , we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics .
I would also like to say a few words on Africa , Madam President .
The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned : just one dollar , one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children .
Europe , which is so democratic , so progressive , does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board , while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases .
One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation .
Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification , just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm .
The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few .
As for the Internet , Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules .
On a personal note , please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who , by acting the way they are , are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated .
We live in a world of rules and regulations : let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future .
Madam President , as a Padanian taxpayer , I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy , Mr Prodi , since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well .
But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket ?
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Members of the Commission , five months after its coming into office , the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union .
The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic .
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that " the world looks up to Europe " ?
Moreover , Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States .
It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace , democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe , no less ?
I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about .
Does " the European integration model as a rich source for global administration " imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power ?
According to the Commission , external policy can succeed , provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge !
So who is this then ?
The Commission as a whole , its President perhaps , the Council ?
You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions , while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks .
We could not agree more with the latter .
It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities .
The document mentions common values on different occasions .
Unfortunately , I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking .
This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on .
I am convinced that the Bible , God ' s word , is the only pure source of proper standards and real values .
In the tradition of our continent , this realisation is an important one which merits recognition .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I am not sure which to go by : the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010 ?
Have you already included your second term of office ?
But seriously .
As it enlarges , the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation .
First , streamlining .
What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning .
The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy .
In other words , a social , ecologically-orientated market , a secure currency , guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally .
It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice ; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important .
Secondly , the new " in " word is flexibility .
However , increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation .
We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States .
That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society , which is a welcome step .
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers .
( Applause )
Transparency does not mean more access to more paper ; to our citizens , transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg , when and with what right .
That is transparency .
Thirdly , the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly .
Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join , but by how many countries it can accommodate .
( Applause )
If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union , then it must not be paid .
It is too high a price , not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union .
There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone .
But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies .
That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life .
In doing so , we need , no less , to reinvent the European Union , but without destroying the present Union .
( Applause )
Madam President , in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party , the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement .
The Commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the Union as soon as possible .
On the other hand , we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down .
It is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the Union will be raised at the IGC .
The subject needs to be discussed without prejudice .
A technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough : we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by Jacques Delors , for example .
In this way , a decision-making system can be created that is more effective , clearer , more open and more democratic .
I hope that the Commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding Union might implement its institutional and other differentiation .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , your inspiring speech , Mr Prodi , has quite won me over .
It raises expectations , but it can also lead to disappointment .
This is connected to what Mr Van Velzen was just saying , about the difference between words and deeds .
The enlargement of the Union is inspired by our wish for peace , security and stability .
You are looking to reassure the acceding countries , as well as European opinion .
But these days , we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes .
We have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet , even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high .
We need to make our citizens feel at home , according to Mr Swoboda , and I agree .
This is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility .
This is probably linked to the standards mentioned by Mr Van Dam , namely subsidiarity .
It is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners , rather than competitors when it comes to policy .
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves .
That will require a new political culture , not only in words , but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of Member States and regions .
Regions which , culturally and economically , sometimes match the interest of some Member States .
The new Europe should not only expand horizontally , but also vertically , by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community .
This is what the Commission will be judged on .
Madam President , the Commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000-2005 . These are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict .
So , in the first part on the new forms of European governance , the words ' federalism ' and ' superstate ' are not mentioned at all .
These ambiguities mask many misunderstandings , primarily about our values .
It is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat .
This Charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights .
In the Union for a Europe of Nations Group our principles are rather different .
Clearly we want to defend the countries of Europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations .
This is not impossible .
We must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on European matters comes from the Memoires of Jean Monnet .
Instead , we must open the European institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations .
This is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication , Mr Prodi , but which is unfortunately not there .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , you claim to be shaping a new Europe yet you are lacking one basic element : confidence .
The confidence of millions of Europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this .
And how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the Santer Commission for corruption ?
You are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty , insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency .
You wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders . Consequently , you have opened Europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration .
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people .
Clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .
Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which , quite obviously , is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre .
Your sabre-rattling fools no one because , as you know perfectly well , whether you like it or not , you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax .
You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union .
Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this .
The governments which , through spinelessness or ideology , support you are also responsible .
Brussels is not all of us , as you claim . It is all of you .
Tell the truth for once . You could not care less what the people of Europe want .
They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement .
It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism .
We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship .
We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship .
We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects .
The salvation of European democracies is with nation states . Europe ' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe .
( Limited applause )
The fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom , which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced .
This social freedom , which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor , gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability .
Mr President , public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion .
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart .
We hope that the White Paper and the actions of you and your Commission will put this into practice .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ' Shaping the new Europe ' is an ambitious objective both for the Commission and for us all .
Our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries , but also by many people outside Europe and the European Union .
What sort of impression will an interested public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five-year programme ?
Consequently , we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom .
I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document . However , there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work .
The first concerns women , gender and women 's rights .
You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth .
That is important , but equality is not only necessary for productivity , but also to make our societies more democratic .
It is therefore noticeable that ' equality ' , ' gender ' and ' women ' are barely mentioned in ' Shaping the New Europe ' .
You mentioned ' women ' in your speech , but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals .
Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women ?
What other explanation could there be for omitting women ?
The EU must not take on a masculine persona .
My other question concerns Africa , which is the only continent not mentioned in ' Shaping the New Europe ' .
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world , the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic .
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect .
Madam President , President of the Commission , this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe .
However , out of all the points , two specifically require our attention , and they are closely linked : peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe .
Moreover , it will only be possible to give the Commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded .
Without these prospects that we have outlined , Europe would , once again , have no future .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome .
I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century .
This event must underpin enlargement .
Rather than using the word ' enlargement ' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance .
Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks . This is one of the goals of your reform .
In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity .
Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence .
However , saying is one thing and doing is another !
You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers .
I will therefore judge you on your deeds .
In the meantime , I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication .
However , I must make two essential points . These concern the simplification and application of Community law .
In 1998 , 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25 % of environmental directives were not applied or transposed .
Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .
Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic .
The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this .
You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us , including unemployment .
Nevertheless , I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed .
The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility .
You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in terms of public health .
This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication .
Finally , you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future .
Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this .
Also , ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these .
If you want to better inform the people , you should start by strengthening liaison with this House , as we are the representatives of the citizens .
Madam President , we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000 , set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning .
Firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors , with the backing of the European Investment Bank .
Secondly , the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via Community projects in the priority sectors of research , innovation and training .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , you have come here today , Mr Prodi , in a very reformist and ambitious mood .
I welcome you and your ambition .
Ambition will be needed , given the mammoth task which awaits us .
We have 1.27 % of the Community ' s GDP .
Not a euro more or a euro less .
It will not be us who refuse these new resources . You should ask the Council .
These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre .
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans , we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4 , and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget .
I would remind you that this Group , the PPE-DE , does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones .
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs .
Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system .
We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them .
Madam President , the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever .
On one hand , there are the words and , on the other , their real political meaning .
We Socialists applaud the Commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty .
Yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled ?
What is meant by the Commission ' s declared objective of ' economic reform ' in the labour market ?
Does this mean more flexibility , insecurity and fixed-term contracts ?
Everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth .
The Union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient .
We Socialists desperately want a European pact for growth and employment .
The ingredients of this policy are well known . They are the stimulation of public and private investment , increased investment in research , education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise .
In this respect , the e-Europe initiative is to be welcomed .
In the world of new technologies , the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are .
The gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era .
On one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and , on the other , more widespread exclusion .
We are asking workers to be flexible , innovative and ever more productive , yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone .
For years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised .
The sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions , leading inevitably to monopoly situations .
All these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15 % , 20 % or 25 % which are unrealistic in the long term .
The unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase .
The main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets .
To conclude , the next five years will be crucial .
We need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people .
We need the Member States and the Commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , in my view , this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses .
There is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one .
I am thinking of transport policy and regional policy .
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these areas .
And do you know why ?
Just look at transport policy ; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries .
I would be grateful if the President of the Commission would listen to what I have to say , although of course he has no obligation to do so .
Let me give you three examples .
First : we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways .
That makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view .
Without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy .
The same applies to European air traffic control .
Our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic , but leaving 15 different sectors in the skies which are under national control , which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment .
You still have not finished that agenda .
Commissioner , far too little is said in your paper about regional policy .
Economic and social cohesion in the EU is a fundamental task of this Community .
If we fail to complete it , citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement .
We must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means .
Then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage .
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000 .
The Agenda 2000 issues are , of course , ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives , the economic and social Agenda and a better quality of life .
What your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major , high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the Commission intends to deploy .
I do not necessarily mean financial resources .
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money .
There must also be savings .
But what we need is the analytical resources : these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital .
It is not easy to combine those aims .
There is no obvious way .
There may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the Commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them .
Perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse .
Madam President , I want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan .
In setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present .
That was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group , Mr Poettering , in his opening address .
The Union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful European economy being in place .
That foundation is clearly the single market .
How strongly is the single market established at the moment ?
I want to remind Mr Prodi , and his colleagues who are still here , of the findings of the Commission ' s own survey among 3000 European businesses .
Nearly 40 % of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications .
This is the Commission ' s own survey .
These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry .
The Commission ' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market .
Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved .
An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union .
The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement .
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security , freedom , citizens ' rights and judicial cooperation .
A paper this short is a farce .
A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand .
A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard .
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it ; we need a basis for a scoreboard .
We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme .
What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly , and those who are not fleeing know where they stand .
We want instruments to prevent abuse .
We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission , even where it is merely submitting a paper .
This is not the case in other areas , as has already been pointed out .
On the other hand , what does this statement tell us about principles ?
It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves , what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve ?
That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones .
We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious .
We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights , environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations .
Having said this , Madam President , I am prepared , once again , to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy .
It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years , in view of the reform which must take place in 2002 .
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years .
We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply .
Madam President , I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi 's programme .
I have one observation , not a criticism , to make regarding Commissioner Prodi 's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy .
We must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the European economy restructured .
After all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?
Full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens .
This is a key priority for us to focus on .
I should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the Commission which will help us : in particular Commissioner Liikanen 's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy .
Yes , e-Europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs .
I welcome the Commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and I would like to congratulate our Portuguese Presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses .
That is important and something that can be developed through the Lisbon Summit .
I also welcome Commissioner Busquin 's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the European Union .
Again , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity .
You said in your summary , Commissioner Prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keeping inflation low , innovation , science and technology are central for the future success of the European economy and creating jobs .
I very much agree with you on that , but we can take nothing for granted . There is still more we have to do , and the Lisbon Summit will become part of that .
So with those remarks I would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme .
To me , this Commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the European Union or a declaration of principle .
Unfortunately , it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission .
As the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group , I would have expected more in the way of agenda from an Italian President of the Commission .
The Commission gives no soul to Europe .
Culture and training simply do not exist in this paper , despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in Europe .
Just a few main points .
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create jobs .
Mr President of the Commission , it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of Europe .
Nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens .
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme .
Truly European citizenship depends on our creating a real , visible area of training and culture .
Declarations of principle are not enough .
We need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the Commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which I have just described .
Madam President , Mr Prodi , how would you take stock of your policy and work programme , what would your benchmark be , if you had to make direct choices ?
You have the fine , charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections , or rather the turnout at the next European elections .
Mr Prodi , what can I say ; what is there that is new ?
There is nothing new in your work programme .
You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year ' s work programme .
Does that give me hope for the year 2000 ?
No , it does not !
In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever .
You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas .
Have you done so , Mr Prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?
No , you have not done so .
You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement , despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement .
Nor have you integrated it into economic policy , competition or the internal market .
You have not integrated it anywhere .
You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure .
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation .
Mr Prodi , you do not know what you are talking about .
The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world .
Where it falls short , what is missing , is transposition in the Member States and monitoring .
It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day ' s work to be done .
That is what we expect of you in the next five years .
( ES ) Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , as chairman of this Parliament ' s Committee on Fisheries , Mr Prodi , you are not making things easy for me at all .
I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us .
The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change .
I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing , since the silence of your programme , with regard to fishing , is deafening .
Not a single line , nor a single word , refers to fishing or the CFP .
I am not asking for details or specific points , but I believe that a mention was required .
How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional impact , and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe ?
Does the Commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ?
This House has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second .
I would therefore ask you , Mr Prodi , to make an explicit reference to this problem in your reply today .
Our parliamentary Group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you .
Mr President of the Commission , this is indeed an historic moment for Parliament , a five-year programme following the crisis of the Commission .
On behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to focus on the point of internal reform .
We wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of Vice-President , Mr Kinnock , on behalf of the Commission .
They want to see results .
Democracy , transparency and clarity always lead to results , citizens value results and this is what the Commission is judged on .
This is exactly the point which Mr Swoboda and also other Members made : fear of modernisation , globalisation , and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security .
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas .
I would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level . This gives the citizen a sense of recognition , here in Europe and elsewhere .
Because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions , such as education and health care .
These are really the people who deserve our solidarity .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I have read and re-read the Commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office .
I am delighted that it is being discussed in Parliament , but I also note the compromises and the omissions in it .
The Commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between Member States and to the European Union ' s regional policy .
And this is true even when it addresses the issue of enlargement .
Are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved ?
Certainly not !
At the same time , it was rightly pointed out that Europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries , and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty .
This document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included .
I think the fact that the Commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious .
It also forgets that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right . Unless we achieve real convergence , the cohesion of the European Union itself will be at risk .
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union , for which the Commission is responsible .
You may draw your own conclusions .
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region , the Azores , one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral .
I am waiting for the Commission ' s report on the ultra-peripheral regions , which the Council decided should be drawn up by December 1999 .
I shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all , only disunity .
You must not allow yourself to be distracted by the sole issue of enlargement , however important this may be .
You must go further , towards reconciling the people with Europe , in particular those people who are falling victim to economic , social and , probably , in the future , technological divisions .
Your action programme and your objectives are reserved , even silent , specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed .
This is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services .
This is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile Europe with the people and ensure that the people choose Europe rather than Jörg Haider .
Madam President , the Commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities .
I therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the Commission 's work programme for 2000 .
However , I was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a European food authority in the recent White Paper .
Furthermore , future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the European food authority and the authorities of national Member States , for example the food safety authority in Ireland .
This body , for example , alongside the recently established cross-border body in Ireland for food safety , is already doing good work .
It would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in EU legislation .
My fear is that such deficiencies in EU legislation could lead to turf wars between national and EU bodies , who should be working together rather than against one another .
That is something we must guard against .
Madam President , the presentation by President Prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair .
We will be looking for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be unveiled this year .
We will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy , and will be applying a number of tests .
Within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the Portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the Portuguese Presidency .
Within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect .
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change .
That is the successful way to manage change , and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place .
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now .
The aspirations are fine , President Prodi , we want those aspirations to be matched by action .
Madam President , I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i 's left for me to dot .
Mr Prodi , you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe .
However , for the economic sector which I represent , i.e. fisheries , this means change .
We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility .
We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry .
What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing .
Plus , this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act , which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too .
This has since been unanimously approved .
The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months ' time , i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000 .
So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper .
I hope that this is a misunderstanding .
Please , Mr Prodi , stand by your word and implement your promises .
Madam President , many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission ' s statement .
However , we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission .
One area that I want to focus on , in addition to those already identified , is that of cultural diversity in Europe .
The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important .
But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity .
Those who are currently coming to the fore in Europe based on fear will win the day .
If we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately .
Thank you , Mr De Rossa .
Before giving the floor again to the President of the Commission , I must tell you that I have received , pursuant to Rule 37 , seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate .
Welcome
I would like to inform you that there is a delegation from Kuwait , led by His Excellency , Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah , Vice-Prime Minister and Defence Minister , here in the official gallery .
On behalf of the House , I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament .
I understand that on 26 January the association wrote to the College of Quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the Hemicycle today to publicise their initiative .
On the same day , I understand , Mr Balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead .
The Parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements .
However , the appointment was cancelled at the last minute .
Parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn .
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received .
Can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute ?
Do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard ?
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last-minute cancellations do not happen again ?
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible ?
Finally , will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament 's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid , as they should be , on the basis of all the work they do for us ?
Without them we would not be able to function .
Mr President , I also rise on a point of order .
Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament , outside the doors of the Hemicycle , to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate ?
If there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?
Mr President , first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants .
Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament .
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament .
To give a non-contentious example , no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons .
Following a letter I received yesterday , I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration , probably in the near future and possibly in the next month .
But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament .
I signed a letter yesterday afternoon , in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament , in which the assistants were informed of this .
But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday , so they were fully aware of the decision .
There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel , there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament 's next part-session .
But there was some misunderstanding , for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission .
But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee .
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament , whether they be about different countries or whatever .
This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants .
Thank you , Mrs Banotti .
I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised .
Mr President , I wanted to point out an important matter of principle .
We shall now proceed to the vote.1
VOTE
However , we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be legally incorrect .
We have also voted in favour of paragraph 13 .
An appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non-EU countries is something which the Spanish People ' s Party has been advocating for some time .
Given the oral amendment , we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done .
.
This report which I voted against is less concerned with human rights than with ' communitisation ' or the consolidation of Fortress Europe .

Secondly , when deciding which areas must be subsidised , we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects .
Disparate actions are not effective .
Thirdly , we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other Community programmes , as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question .
Finally , we have to put our trust in , and support , the institutions which are closest to the citizens , that is , the local councils and bodies .
Lastly , in today ' s vote on our four amendments , two have been approved and the other two rejected .
Mr President , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism had an in-depth discussion on the URBAN initiative which produced many ideas .
As the smallest Community initiative in existence , we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected .
The Commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place . It should make URBAN projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled ' sustainable urban policy ' .
Mr President , I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development , known as URBAN .
As with all other Community initiatives , this is very positive .
Europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of Europe and not simply for the development of an individual State , whichever one it may be .
URBAN is designed to find solutions to urban decay , and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the Pensioners ' Party .
There can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city .
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities .
.
( DA ) The Left ' s five Members of the European Parliament have chosen to support LEADER + , the EQUAL initiative and INTERREG , but not URBAN .
At a forthcoming review of these programmes , it ought to be established that the EU ' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross-border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the EU .
.
This report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences , i.e. increasing unemployment , exclusion and delinquency .
However , nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it .
At best this report simply corrects certain aspects and effects of the crisis . Yet only scandalously limited resources are available for this work .
With some 80 % of the population of Europe living in an urban area , cities are at the forefront of economic , social and cultural change in Europe .
At the same time , the social and economic problems facing European society are more pronounced in urban areas .
The concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved .
This is why the European Parliament successfully called for the URBAN Community Initiative or CIP to be extended during the reform of the Structural Funds .
The success of URBAN during the 1994-1999 programming period is indisputable .
The results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas .
This CIP has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic , social and environmental sectors .
It has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities , the non-governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration .
The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them , while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups .
We can therefore welcome its adoption .
We must , however , admit that in financial terms we cannot proclaim a victory ! The total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge .
The amount for the 1994-1999 period was EUR 900 million and will be EUR 700 million for the 2000-2006 period . This represents a drop of 30 % !
This reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new URBAN initiative .
The chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low .
It needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the Member States .
In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects , the publication and dissemination of the results of the new URBAN Community Initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect .
The McCarthy report on the URBAN Community Initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of Community intervention in urban matters .
The situation of certain urban areas is alarming , with the social distress taking the form of unemployment , misery and crime .
Drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency .
Faced with these social challenges , the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt .
Although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises , the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way .
The URBAN Community Initiative is helping to achieve the European Union ' s desire to communitise urban policy .
It would be more appropriate for the EU to concentrate its financial efforts on pre-existing European policies .
Mrs McCarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to URBAN and the promotion of this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign extolling the benefits of a federal Europe .
We should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project .
In fact , the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted .
The aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility .
Finally , the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or sociological minorities .
We can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion .
On the other hand , it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination . This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful , as shown by the US precedent .
For all these reasons , the French delegation of the UEN Group could not approve the McCarthy report .
Decourrière report ( A5-0028 / 2000 )
Mr President , the INTERREG programme is particularly close to our hearts .
Like many of my colleagues , I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to safeguard this initiative .
These projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development .
Why am I stressing this point ?
The answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted .
For example , to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the European Union . This goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions , for example .
I am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction .
We know that some Member States are still wavering , for example , between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees , as in the Aspe valley .
However , I am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway , the A32 .
In this respect too , I would ask the Commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies , specifically in the INTERREG programmes which are being submitted .
I voted for it , not just because I was born in a coastal town , Genoa , but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too .
These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East : we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe .
As an MEP from a border region , I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest .
We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically , socially and culturally .
Due to the existence of these borders , they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong . This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy .
This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990 .
This programme was designed to encourage cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union .
INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs , education and training , cultural exchanges , action to combat health problems , the protection and improvement of the environment , energy , transport and telecommunications networks .
I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration .
In cross-border cooperation , greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators .
In the same respect , given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50 % of all unemployment , the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment .
Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing , braking or hindering cross-border mobility .
INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area .
Finally , and in particular , expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG !
The challenges are therefore immense . The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy !
I hope everyone , like Mr Decourrière , whom I congratulate , will realise this !
- ( FR ) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy .
Between 1994 and 1999 , our regions annually received an average of FF 15.4 billion but will receive only FF 14.7 billion between 2000 and 2006 .
My region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais will be particularly affected with French Hainaut losing the aid paid to Objective 1 regions .
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe .
The European regional policy also reinforces the centralism of Brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the Structural Funds .
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions , which are weaker than the nation states , will easily submit to Brussels .
The INTERREG initiative , launched in 1990 to prepare the border regions for a Europe without borders and therefore without nations , sits comfortably within this philosophy .
However , these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted , in no way remedy the Eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the Community initiatives , particularly INTERREG .
This is why the National Front voted against the report .
The European Parliament has delivered an opinion on the Commission guidelines for the INTERREG Community Initiative concerning cross-border , transnational and interregional cooperation .
I want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this Community initiative .
This does not involve the concerns about the future of the Atlantic Arc but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand A on cross-border cooperation .
In the Commission guidelines , few maritime areas are eligible for INTERREG IIIA .
The amendments to the Decourrière report aim to make INTERREG more maritime-oriented .
This is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the EU which is at stake .
I am aware of the Commission ' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November .
However , I must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation .
The European Commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions .
This policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in Brittany in that catches could be unloaded at Irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the Breton agri-foodstuffs industry .
The integration of the maritime border into strand A would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the ' continentalisation ' of the European Union .
This would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east .
The maritime world has great potential .
We therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot Community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of Europe to be defined .
.
( DA ) The European project began as a partnership between States .
This partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of Europe for over 50 years .
The EU should be prepared to meet that competition .
We can only do that by intensifying co-operation within the Community .
It should not be about greater integration of the EU countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders .
It is about co-operating on joint projects and about unifying forces on all sides .
I therefore welcome the continuation of the programme .
.
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States , as suggested in recital of the report .
We only ask one thing of the Commission : that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories .
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States .
It is up to Washington , not us , to assume responsibility for a conflict which was triggered merely to serve its interests .
The French delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the Decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote .
Procacci report ( A5-0025 / 2000 )
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed .
- ( PT ) Although this Community initiative , LEADER + , follows on from previous initiatives , it has some unique features .
One of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period .
Nevertheless , new objectives have been included , specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000 , for which all rural regions will be eligible .
In spite of the fact that this Community initiative is aimed at rural development , it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way , and this is unacceptable .
Without agriculture , the rural world will disappear .
This means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture ' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world .
Our position on LEADER is a product of our more general assessment of the EU ' s overall agricultural policy .
This is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented , farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly , which resulted in their depopulation .
We think LEADER + will be even more ineffectual than LEADER 1 and LEADER 2 , for the following reasons .
In no case , however , are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature .
LEADER + will last a year longer than LEADER 2 .
LEADER + can cover all the regions of the EU , while LEADER 2 covered only the Objective 1 regions and some Objective 5b and 6 regions .
We disagree with many of the report ' s views .
Once more , we point to the negative changes of the CAP ( 1992 - Agenda 2000 ) .
For our part , we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes .
Unless this CAP is overthrown , no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium-scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside .
All the Members in the Union for a Europe of Nations Group voted in favour of almost the whole of the Procacci report on the LEADER + Community Initiative .
However , we amended the draft report adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to clarify certain points which will make this Community initiative more effective .
